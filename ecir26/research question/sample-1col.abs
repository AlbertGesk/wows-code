Query expansion via pseudo-relevance feedback is a well-established technique to improve
  retrieval effectiveness in information retrieval systems. Among classical approaches,
  Bo1 and RM3 are frequently used but exhibit varying effectiveness depending on the
  retrieval setting. In this work, we empirically compare Bo1 and RM3 query expansion
  within a controlled Retriever-Rewriter-Retriever pipeline using the DPH retrieval model.
  Experiments are conducted on the \textit{radboud-validation-20251114-training} dataset
  using nDCG@10 as evaluation metric. Statistical significance testing shows that neither
  a significant difference nor a significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness can be
  observed between Bo1 and RM3 under identical parameter settings.
