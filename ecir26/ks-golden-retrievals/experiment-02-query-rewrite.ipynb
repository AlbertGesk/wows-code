       "  'text': 'Can bad teeth cause gastritis? (Link between Oral Disease and Gastritis) Gastritis is a common condition affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or eroded. This allows gastric acid and digestive enzymes to irritate the sensitive tissue underneath. In mild cases, gastritis may cause temporary discomfort or indigestion. But it can potentially lead to more serious complications like stomach ulcers or bleeding in severe instances.\\nGastritis can be acute and short-lived or chronic if it persists for months or years. There are several contributing factors, but one potential cause that has been investigated recently is poor oral health. Links between dental problems like gum disease, cavities, and bad breath and higher gastritis risk are being uncovered. But does simply having bad teeth actually directly cause stomach inflammation? Let’s review the evidence surrounding this emerging connection.\\nOral Health and The Gut Microbiome\\nThe human digestive tract contains over 700 species of bacteria, totalling in the trillions of cells. This complex microbial ecosystem is referred to collectively as the gut microbiome. While most of these microbes reside in the large intestine, millions also live in the mouth. The oral microbiome contains some beneficial bacteria that protect teeth and gums. But certain species can cause problems if allowed to overgrow.\\nOral bacteria thrive in plaque biofilms that form on teeth. Two of the most common culprits for dental disease are Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. S. mutans produces acid that erodes tooth enamel and causes cavities. P. gingivalis triggers chronic inflammation damaging the gums, ligaments and bone in advanced periodontal disease.\\nSaliva acts as a transport system, constantly washing some oral microbes down the throat and into the digestive tract. Oral bacteria have been found in the stomachs of both healthy individuals and those with gastritis. But those with poor oral hygiene tend to harbor higher levels of potentially inflammatory bacteria. This raises the possibility that large amounts of pathogenic plaque microbes are able to directly colonize or irritate the stomach lining.\\nEvidence Linking Oral Disease and Gastritis\\nInitial evidence supporting a potential link between oral health and stomach inflammation includes:\\nCorrelation studies: Numerous studies have found associations between gum disease, dental plaque and bad breath and higher incidence of gastritis. Having 8 or more untreated decayed teeth has also been linked to increased gastritis likelihood.\\nH. pylori connections: This stomach-dwelling bacteria is the top cause of gastritis worldwide. Patients with periodontal disease have been shown to have higher rates of H. pylori in dental plaque. The bacteria may spread between mouth and stomach.\\nAlso Read\\xa0 Can popcorn damage gums? Why & How to Prevent?\\nOral bacteria in the gut: Analyses find greater colonization with oral microbes like P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium in the guts and stomachs of gastritis patients compared to healthy controls.\\nDental treatment effects: Successfully treating gum disease and reducing dental plaque appears to lessen gut inflammation and gastritis symptoms in some patients.\\nAnimal models: Rodent studies demonstrate directly seeding the stomach with P. gingivalis can induce gastritis-like pathology.\\nHowever, most evidence so far is limited to correlations that do not prove direct causation. Plausible mechanisms have been proposed but clinical studies isolating oral health as a definitive trigger for gastritis are lacking.\\nPotential Biological Mechanisms\\nPotential Biological Mechanisms\\nIf poor oral hygiene does contribute to stomach inflammation, what are the possible biological explanations? Researchers have suggested a few different ways oral bacteria might act as gastric irritants:\\nDirect colonization: Higher proportions of oral microbes found in the stomachs of those with gastritis indicate these bacteria can survive transit from mouth to gut. Once there, they may bind to stomach cells and release inflammatory factors. H. pylori can also settle in plaque before spreading to the stomach.\\nAltered gastric pH: Certain oral bacteria produce chemicals that lower stomach pH when swallowed. These create favorable conditions for colonization by acid-tolerant microbes. A chronically acidic gastric environment is also directly caustic to the stomach lining.\\nImmune stimulation: Oral microbes and their endotoxins arriving in the stomach could trigger inflammatory cytokine release. This inappropriate immune reaction could contribute to chronic gastric inflammation even without direct colonization or pH changes.\\nNutritional impact: Vitamin B12 produced by oral bacteria helps maintain gastric mucosal integrity. Periodontal disease-causing bacteria interfere with B12 production. Resulting B12 deficiency makes the stomach lining more vulnerable to erosion.\\nHormonal influence: Oral bacteria may affect stomach inflammation via changes to ghrelin, leptin and H. pylori virulence factors. But this mechanism needs further research.\\nThe interplay between the oral and gastric microbiomes is complex with many unanswered questions. But several plausible pathways exist by which poor oral hygiene could instigate or enable stomach irritation.\\nCan Dental Treatment Improve Gastritis?\\nIf oral bacteria can worsen gastritis, it would make sense that improving oral hygiene and controlling dental disease could reduce stomach inflammation. However, clinical evidence testing this hypothesis is still preliminary:\\nA few small studies report intensive dental cleanings and antibacterial treatment lowered pepsin and H. pylori levels in dental plaque and reduced gut inflammation short-term.\\nCase reports describe gastritis patients with marked dental disease who improved after receiving extensive dental rehabilitation.\\nConversely, another trial found treating gum disease had no effect on the stomach health of helicobacter-infected patients over 8 weeks.\\nNo large scale randomized studies have yet examined dental disease treatment on confirmed gastritis outcomes.\\nAlso Read\\xa0 11 Dental Diseases That Are Hereditary?\\nResearch specifically isolating oral health interventions is limited. But overall, multiple studies demonstrate that steps like professional cleanings, plaque removal, and certain oral antibiotics tend to decrease oral-gastric bacterial transmission. While not irrefutable, optimizing dental health is unlikely to worsen gastritis. For some individuals it may provide adjunctive benefits when combined with other gastric therapies. Larger clinical trials are warranted to better evaluate potential gastritis-mitigating dental treatments.\\nCan Gastritis Affect Oral Health?\\nCan Gastritis Affect Oral Health\\nAnother question is whether having gastritis predisposes patients to accelerated dental disease. A few possible mechanisms exist:\\nChronic gastritis can cause vitamin B12 deficiency, negatively affecting gum health and dental recovery.\\nFrequent reflux of gastric acid into the mouth gradually erodes tooth enamel.\\nProinflammatory cytokines generated during active gastritis may exacerbate periodontal inflammation.\\nH. pylori infection simultaneously increases risk for dental plaque accumulation and gastritis when present in both sites.\\nThe overall dental impact of having gastritis compared to being stomach-healthy has not been well quantified. But some bidirectional relationship where each condition can influence the other is biologically plausible. More research is needed to clarify how gastric disorders might contribute to poor oral health over time.\\nConclusions and Recommendations\\nEvidence increasingly suggests that poor oral hygiene and dental disease correlated strongly with higher gastritis likelihood. The rationale is that harmful oral bacteria reaching the gut via swallowing may directly irritate the stomach lining and contribute to inflammation. Preliminary studies also indicate that dental treatment has the potential to decrease oral-gastric bacterial transmission and perhaps aid gastritis management for some patients.\\nHowever, absolute proof that removing dental biofilms and addressing cavities, gum disease and bad breath can directly treat or prevent gastritis remains lacking. Oral health is just one piece of the complex gastritis puzzle. Key steps like eradicating H. pylori, avoiding irritants like NSAIDs and alcohol, and reducing stress are likely to have more potent effects for resolving active stomach inflammation.\\nAlso Read\\xa0 Can Bottom Teeth Be Built Up? (Step-By-Step Process)\\nIn general, gastritis patients are advised to maintain diligent oral hygiene practices like brushing, flossing, and regular dental cleanings. Stopping smoking is also beneficial. While unproven, controlling oral biofilms may be helpful for decreasing one possible gastritis trigger. More rigorous research is warranted to determine if intensive dental therapy should become a mainstay recommendation for gastritis treatment. In the meantime, focusing on known effective interventions remains key for managing this common and often challenging digestive disorder.\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\nQ: Can cavities directly give you gastritis?\\nIt is unlikely cavities alone directly cause gastritis. However, untreated cavities allow more plaque accumulation with harmful bacteria that could irritate the stomach. Getting cavities promptly filled reduces this risk.\\nQ: Will fixing all my dental problems get rid of my gastritis?\\nBased on current evidence, dental treatment alone cannot cure gastritis in most cases. While improving oral health may help, other factors like diet, stress reduction and eliminating H. pylori are usually more important.\\nQ: Does having gastritis put me at higher risk for dental issues?\\nSome research indicates gastritis may contribute to gum disease progression and enamel erosion from repeated acid reflux. So dental problems might be more likely with concurrent gastritis.\\nQ: Should I take antibiotics before dental work if I have gastritis?\\nThe American Dental Association does not specifically recommend antibiotics for dental procedures in gastritis patients. Discuss your complete medical history with your dentist and gastroenterologist.\\nQ: What are the best dental hygiene practices for gastritis patients?\\nBrush thoroughly twice daily, floss once daily, use antiseptic mouthwash, replace your toothbrush regularly, get professional cleanings every 6 months, treat any gum disease or cavities promptly, avoid smoking and limit sugary foods.\\nSimilar Posts'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Men after #MeToo: ‘There’s a narrative that masculinity is fundamentally toxic' | #MeToo movement | The Guardian Skip to main contentSkip to navigationSkip to navigation\\nIllustration of a man struggling under the weight of a giant male symbol\\nIllustration: Igor Bastidas/Guardian\\nIllustration: Igor Bastidas/Guardian\\nMen after #MeToo: ‘There’s a narrative that masculinity is fundamentally toxic'\\nThis article is more than 7 years old\\nCan a new men’s movement bring a positive shift?\\nOne of the first things I discovered at the men’s group was that most men are scared of other men. Here we all were, 25 or so specimens of metropolitan masculinity, gathered in a London yoga studio to spend our Saturday learning how to “get vulnerable” with Rebel Wisdom, a newly formed men’s collective. “In today’s world, for men to be vulnerable and speak their truth is an act of rebellion,” says its chic new age website. “We exist to fuel this rebellion.”\\nIn practice, this meant we were going to spend a day doing breathing exercises, talking about our fathers, pretending to be tigers, leaning on one another, working out which Jungian archetypes we vibed with, and trying to articulate why we all felt so defensive and angry and misunderstood so much of the time. But first we had to stand in a circle and say how we were feeling. And one by one, the men – mostly in their mid-30s, mostly straight, mostly white – said they were afraid. One guy, a straight-talking youth worker, reckoned that if the estate kids he worked with could see him now, they’d rip the piss and would probably be right to. Another, extremely gaunt and pale, had recently suffered a huge emotional and physical breakdown, and confessed that this was the first time he had been out in weeks. When it came to my turn, I said I was hungover. (Humour is a good way of deflecting uncomfortable feelings, I find.) Then I tried a bit harder: “I can’t remember the last time I was in a room with all men,” I said. “I actively avoid these situations. And maybe that’s quite strange.”\\nThe next thing I learned was that men – at least the sort who come to men’s groups – are quite nice, really. No one laughed or took the piss. We all listened sympathetically to each other talking about sporting humiliations and paternal misunderstandings. The organisers promised there would be no group hugs, but there were lots of group hugs. They also exhorted us to be honest. “What if you just told the Truth?” the invite read. I left feeling lighter, warmer, but no wiser as to what that truth might be.\\nI don’t know if you’ve noticed, but men are not exactly giving the best account of themselves at the moment. Every week brings another high-profile reminder of unhealthy masculinity, from Harvey Weinstein to Aziz Ansari to the former Oxfam boss Roland van Hauwermeiren. Clearly, something needs to shift. Like all the male friends I’ve spoken to recently, I’ve found the current reckoning disorienting at times, shaming at others, but mostly exciting, necessary and liberating. I’ve seen the overwhelmingly positive effect it’s had on many women in my life. But there are moments – say when I’m happily cooking with my son – when the dominant narrative of masculinity as toxic, entitled, corrupt, dysfunctional and so on seems a little limiting. If you’ve always found men such as Weinstein despicable and pathetic, it’s disorienting to find yourself in the same category as him by virtue of also having a penis. A couple of times, I’ve begun the sentence: “You know, not all men… ” only to recall that that in itself is seen as a dick move. And there are clearly dissonances in political, legal and psychological notions of gender that require careful unpicking: for example, the feminist notion that masculinity is in full control of itself and consciously uses sex to cement its power doesn’t quite tally with our understanding of the subconscious. Masculinity is very rarely under control and sexual abuse is often perpetrated by men who are threatened (often by other men), vulnerable, damaged, lashing out. Not that this insight can be expected to provide solace for their victims.\\nPerhaps all the moment requires is for men to shut up and listen, something many clearly find hard. But watching the hashtags accrue – #menaretrash, etc – it’s often hard to discern any positive role for men, beyond apologetic retweeters of feminist memes. And there’s a wider defensiveness around masculinity. The comedian Robert Webb titled his memoir How Not To Be A Boy: a negative inversion of Caitlin Moran’s celebratory How To Build A Girl. “If you want a vision of masculinity,” Webb writes, “imagine Dr Frankenstein being constantly bum-raped by his own monster while shouting, ‘I’m fine, everyone! I’m absolutely fine!’”\\nBut as we know, men are not fine. Boys get worse grades than girls. Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 35; men also report significantly lower life satisfaction than women. According to statistics compiled by the Men’s Health Forum, men make up 76% of all suicides, 95% of the prison population, 73% of adults who go missing and 87% of rough sleepers. A key part of this is men’s reluctance to seek help. Last year’s cross-party Jo Cox Commission described male loneliness as a “silent epidemic”: more than one in 10 say they are lonely but won’t usually admit it.\\n“One of the problems is that in the last 10 years or so, the world hasn’t really been interested in the psychology of gender,” says the psychotherapist Nick Duffell. “What we’ve been interested in are transgender issues and free choice and pronouns and gender as a social construct and abuses of power. But one of the things I’ve been working with is how powerless men often feel in the private sphere. Men are very unskilled when it comes to relationships and dealing with their emotions. We need to train them to be better at vulnerability, better at relating – and when they begin to do that, the power they develop is more authentic.”\\nUS poet Robert Bly encouraged men to find their ‘Zeus energy’ in his 1990s bestseller Iron John. Photograph: Alamy\\nIt is a few weeks after the men’s group and I have come to the launch of something called (for now) Men’s Movement 2.0 at 42 Acres, a “transformational” space in east London. The scent of orange blossom is in the air; green creepers hang from the ceiling; amethyst crystals are warding off bad energy and, hopefully, any men’s rights activist (MRA) types who might mistake this for some sort of alt-right/anti-feminist hate-in. The men here are keen to distinguish themselves from these “MRAs” – who they feel have given men’s groups a bad name – and instead look back to the original men’s movement, which had its origins in the early 1970s as a male adjunct to radical feminism, and went on to give the world terms such as “male bonding”, as well as the 1990s bestseller Iron John by the American poet Robert Bly, who urged men to locate their “Zeus energy” and “sun-like grandeur”. Among those present are Kenny “the Man Whisperer” Mammarella-D’Cruz, who hosts informal drop-in sessions for men; Nathan Roberts of the charity A Band of Brothers, which pairs elder male mentors with young ex-offenders; and Paul Robson of the Nordic Men’s Gathering. Still, the fact that the Weinstein scandal has broken between this event and the last one – as well as the female “allies” in the audience this time – might explain why the atmosphere is a little more charged than it was a few weeks before.\\nAt the outset, David Fuller, 42, a film-maker and one of the founders of Rebel Wisdom, outlines what Men’s Movement 2.0 hopes to achieve. He has been on a personal journey these past few years, he explains, and of all the “work” he has done – from psychedelics to tantra – he has gained most from “men’s work”: men coming together in small groups, “holding space”, sharing their “fierce loving energy” and helping each other grow. Women give birth to boys, but men give birth to men is an axiom of the movement. A man must “do the work” to develop his own independence and grow into a “relaxed masculine confidence” that is not threatened by the feminine. Something magical and unexpected happens when men help each other do this, Fuller believes – and it’s something the world is calling out for in 2018.\\n“Around the election of Donald Trump, it felt really significant that a lot of issues around masculinity were being reflected in the culture,” he tells the 60 or so attendees. “How is it possible that a man who boasts of sexual assault can be elected to the most significant public role in the world? It spoke to a deep dysfunction around our ideas of healthy masculinity. But, at the same time, there’s a narrative that there’s something about masculinity that’s fundamentally toxic.” What we need to do as a society – but particularly as men – he says, is to redefine “healthy masculinity”. A masculinity that is no better or worse than femininity, but that stands as its opposite, equal pole.\\nOne of the themes that has come to the fore is that women shouldn’t have to perform the emotional labour of teaching men how not to harass and assault them – just as it shouldn’t be down to people of colour to call out and explain racism. Reflect. Be humble. Work this out. Admit fault. This seems compatible with the core precept of men’s work, which involves men sorting out their shit with other men. But the question is, when men get together to talk about men, do they say the sorts of things that women would like to hear?\\nAs the Men’s Movement 2.0 launch gets underway, I’m not so sure. There is lots of talk about anima and animus, about how men need to make peace with their inner feminine. The lack of male role models and masculine rites of passage is mourned. Duffell, a veteran of the first men’s movement, talks about how important it is for men to learn to admit their vulnerability. “We’ve been educated out of vulnerability!” Then an audience member becomes frustrated and asks why we’re talking about our feelings when violent male fascists are marching on the streets in Poland. “But how does that make you feel?” Duffell asks.\\n“It makes me angry!” the audience member says.\\n“So why don’t you just say that? I’m angry and scared!”\\nRafia Morgan, another veteran facilitator, talks about the origins of the men’s movement at Berkeley, California, in 1968. Then we watch a video from a Nordic Men’s Gathering, whose founder, Paul Robson, tells us that in egalitarian Sweden they’re about five years ahead of us in their approach to gender and celebrate strong healthy masculinity. Nathan Roberts of A Band of Brothers talks about how older men are a “vast, untapped social resource” and encourages us all to volunteer to help vulnerable younger men. Someone asks if gay men have a role in the movement. “Yes! All are welcome!” Then we spend a long time discussing whether Men’s Movement 2.0 is a good name.\\nFinally, someone remarks that it would be interesting to hear from one of the women in the room. “Come on, girls, speak up!” One woman says she’s been leading feminist groups for years and it’s interesting how similar the discussions are: “Obviously, there’s a different energy, and it’s complicated where the patriarchy starts coming in,” she says. “But we’ve been doing this sort of work for a long time and we talk about similar things.”\\nSurprisingly, this is the first time anyone has mentioned the word “patriarchy”, and it produces a frisson. Roberts steps up: “For me, it’s about the idea that we’re equal, but different,” he says. “I have a biochemical experience based on testosterone; a woman has a biochemical experience based on oestrogen. It’s a different sort of consciousness, in my belief. But there’s also a historical aspect. We as men have denied the effects of patriarchy for centuries. We can’t deny that. But if we lump all men and patriarchy in together, men end up nailed to the tree of history and feel a sense of shame that they will never escape from.”\\n“Stop calling it patriarchy!” comes a voice from the crowd – an angry-looking guy with a ZZ Top-style beard – possibly a stray men’s rights activist. “We shouldn’t gender a co-created system!”\\n“But the reality is, at the top of our society, the vast majority of people are men,” Roberts continues. “The question is how to differentiate that from masculinity itself.”\\n“But do we really need to differentiate it?” Everyone turns to Robson, the Swedish guy. “It sounds to me that there’s some sort of negative association there. What you see in the most gender-equal societies like Sweden is that it’s still the males at the top, and there’s actually a lower percentage of females in leadership positions. For me this idea that we should smash the patriarchy, that men in power are evil, this is quite misguided, you know? Western society is actually kind of OK compared with any other society that’s ever existed. And it was built by a patriarchal system. These are guys working hard to make the world a better place. Yes, there’s corruption and so forth, but actually I think we’re doing better than anywhere else in the whole world.”\\nI notice Fuller and Morgan exchanging a pained glance. Two of the women behind me snort. “For fuck’s sake…”\\nAfter the talk, I approach Robson and ask him to elaborate. “Well, I don’t want to be fact-checked on this, but the more equal a society becomes, the greater the specific psychological difference between the genders becomes. I got that off a Jordan Peterson video, but he’s kind of an expert on the issue, right?” Peterson is a controversial Canadian psychologist and mythographer, whose recent bestseller, 12 Rules for Life, urges disillusioned young men to “take responsibility”. He spends a lot of time talking about masculine order and feminine chaos, and is a favourite of the Rebel Wisdom crew, too.\\nControversial self-help guru Jordan Peterson is popular with men’s collective Rebel Wisdom. Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star via Getty Images\\nI ask Robson what he thinks of society’s current discussions ongender. “I see a lot of good things in the #MeToo campaign, but I also see a lot of angry women,” he says. “All these women are angry at the masculine and they’re angry at men, and this is not helping the guys who are already feeling insecure in their masculinity.” Maybe they’re not trying to help men, I say, maybe they’re trying to help other women? Robson seems disappointed with the way the evening has gone. “There is this feminine way of talking here in the UK, it’s very passive-aggressive.” You could call it respectful? “The problem is that there’s a polite surface and underneath things get really angry.” He worries darkly that Europe could be about to see an uprising of the far right, precisely because we haven’t located our “healthy masculine”.\\nOther men seem to be frustrated, too. Nelson Melina wasn’t sure we got to grips with patriarchy: “There are some men at the top of society who make decisions, sure. But competence is not a bad thing. Oppression is what’s bad. I don’t subscribe to this idea that we live in a system of victims and oppressors. There are different games that can be played in life, you have advantages in some, you have disadvantages in others.”\\nJason Ho, one of a handful of gay men here, tells me the presence of women made everyone too cautious. “I think if we were in a room with all men, the conversation would have gone differently. We would have got to the patriarchy question much quicker. With women around, it’s more formal, there’s less banter and cut and thrust.” He says his entire social life consists of men’s groups. “I wanted more from life, I wanted more from myself and more from other people. Before, I just didn’t have many straight male friends. And I feel so close to my brothers now. I don’t want to socialise in standard social scenarios any more.”\\nThe patriarchy question is one that has been exercising Dave Pickering for some time. A London-based writer and performer, he interviewed 1,000 men about patriarchy for his live show, Mansplaining Masculinity, which he is now turning into a book via the crowdfunding publisher Unbound. About 85% of the men he interviewed thought patriarchy exists; some thought it was a good thing; some didn’t; some protested about the premise of the question; others cut-and-pasted the dictionary definition (“a system in which men have all or most of the power and importance in a society or group”). But it did provoke unexpected confessions. “A lot of men talked about being unfairly promoted, and not doing enough domestic chores,” Pickering says. “But a few were really surprising. One man said, ‘I raped my girlfriend because I didn’t know what rape was.’”\\nPickering feels one of the reasons men become so defensive about patriarchy is the idea that they are supposed to be benefiting from it when, in fact, so many of us are suffering under it. “The main breadwinner is not a pleasant place to be. The person who is expected to use violence to defend people is not a healthy place to be. More men are in prison, more men are in the army, men are more likely to hurt other men, and it’s usually because they’re policing masculinity. My mum told me that men are wrong and men are sick. That’s something I internalised. And that’s part of patriarchy. Hating ourselves is social conditioning, this idea that there’s only one way to be, and if we don’t feel that way, we should be ashamed.” Pickering has come to question the entire idea of gender, believing it’s just another way for society to categorise us. As loaded a term as “masculinity” doesn’t begin to reflect the range of experiences and thoughts and feelings that men actually have.\\nSoon after the launch, the tensions in the Men’s Movement 2.0 inevitably rise to the surface. Everyone seems to have found Robson too aggressive. There are further disagreements about whether to call it a men’s movement at all. When I describe all this to my wife, she seem unsurprised that we lacked direction. “When women get together, we don’t talk about femininity. We talk about rights.” Perhaps with no specific political cause to rally around, men have nothing else to contemplate other than our wounded feelings.\\nBut that’s still a lot to contemplate – and even if no one can agree on what to call the movement, it seems to be gathering pace. Fuller recently flew out to Canada to interview Jordan Peterson for his new Rebel Wisdom multimedia channel, and plans a series of intensive men’s retreats for the summer. You could spend all summer at similar events: at Hero’s Journey, a weekender in Wiltshire, men are encouraged to live out the transformation process of ancient myths in a woodland: “We’re offering this retreat as a safe space, in which – supported by the fellowship of a group of men – you can move towards a chosen new dream or goal, face your fears and learn from them, and open to new inspiration and direction,” says “holistic explorer” Will Gethin.\\nWhen I meet Morgan for coffee a few weeks later, he remains convinced that the men’s work he helped pioneer at Berkeley in the early 70s is precisely what the moment requires. Only he points to a difference in scale. Back then, the aim was to reach hundreds of people. In the digital age, a few well-placed memes and YouTube videos mean that men’s work could reach millions. Every generation has to learn these lessons for itself, and Morgan recognises in the younger men he mentors many of the conflicts he was working through when his mind was blown by the radical feminists of the early 70s. He moved into a house of male radicals who saw themselves as feminist allies, launched a men’s radio station and held co-counselling sessions. But at one of these sessions, he had an epiphany. “I remember listening to all these polite, middle-class men, full of guilt, full of anger, full of despair… And I had this image of them sawing their own balls off.”\\nHe was “completely lost” at the time. His father had just died and he become a father himself, unexpectedly: a woman had become pregnant with his child, deliberately and without his consent, he says, which left him confused and angry. But then he walked into a “bioenergetic men’s encounter group”, an offshoot of the human potential movement then taking shape in California. “These guys just saw me for who I was. I was completely out of touch with my anger. And I just had this anger fit in front of them all.” He has now been leading men’s groups for 40 years.\\n“What it’s so good at doing is breaking down the traditional ways men are supposed to relate,” he explains. “I find men incredibly generous with one another when they come together like that. There’s an implicit support for all men, the wounded men, the insecure men.” The message he finds himself giving, time and time again, is that men need to work on being present. Simply listening. “I find a present man is by his nature solid, loving, kind, protective. He’s not threatened by his own femininity, or the external feminine. He knows how to make women feel valued. And the problem is, women feel devalued by a patriarchal culture that’s run by castrated men and other devalued women.”\\nI can’t argue with Morgan’s central conceit that it’s a good idea for men to be present, but isn’t it a good idea for women to be present, too? I’m not sure my own experiences with men’s groups have left me more embodied in my masculinity (no doubt I haven’t gone deep enough). I also wonder if viewing everything through the prism of masculinity really helps men to be better men. If I didn’t spend much time worrying about whether I was being true to my gender identity beforehand, I sure as hell did afterwards.\\nStill, I take some comfort from the main thing I learned from men’s groups. Not one of us has a clue what he’s doing. I think it’s one reason many men are finding this moment so hard: we are perceived to have the power, yet most of us feel powerless in relation to our own lives, emotions, relations. You get a real rush when you admit that in front of another man, and another rush when you hear pretty much the same thing echoed back. It may not be much to work with, but it’s a start.\\nCommenting on this piece?

Get Your Healthy Stomach Back\\nDiseases Caused by H. pylori\\nNot all H. pylori infections lead to the development of ulcers and stomach cancer.\\nHowever, most people infected do develop gastritis. Unless eradicated, H. pylori will remain in the stomach, which will continue to cause chronic inflammation, weakening the protective force of the mucus membrane of the stomach, creating a condition whereby it is vulnerable to attack by stress, salty meals, and carcinogenic substances. Some treatments can be covered by national health insurance in Japan, so please consult your doctor.\\nGastritis\\nThere are two types of gastritis, acute gastritis and chronic gastritis.\\nTypical causes of acute gastritis include excessive alcohol consumption, eating hot spices, and some types of medication (e.g. NSAIDs*, antibiotics). Chronic gastritis is often caused by H. pylori, with the stomach's mucus membrane becoming inflamed.\\n*Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs\\nStomach and Duodenal Ulcers\\nStomach and duodenal ulcers occur when the protective layer of mucosa has been weakened by H. pylori, allowing stomach acid to eat away at this mucus membrane of the stomach and duodenum, finally damaging the stomach or duodenum walls.\\nStomach Cancer\\nStomach cancer is a disease that produces malignant cells (cancer cells) in stomach tissues.

       "  'text': '#MeToo, two years on: What\\'s changed at PR agencies | PR Week #MeToo, two years on: What\\'s changed at PR agencies\\nHarassment policies are largely the same, but employee training and advice has evolved.\\nPhoto credit: Getty images\\nTwo years after the beginning of the #MeToo movement, many PR agency leaders say they have not significantly changed their sexual harassment policies, but that doesn’t mean they’re ducking the issue.\\xa0\\nAgency executives say they have not updated the language of HR policies because PR firms mostly addressed harassment in their human resources standards long before the fall of men such as Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer and Steve Wynn.\\n\"You can take a bunch of old white guys who came up in the industry and who have behaved a certain way their entire careers and you can try to teach them a new language and teach them a new behavior and make them aware there are severe consequences if they don’t do that,\" says Robert Dowling, CEO of Hudson Cutler. \"But at the end of the day, you have a lot that’s still lost in translation. There are no policies that will truly get these guys culturally and socially attuned to this massive amount of change.\"\\nSo while #MeToo may not have prompted an industry-wide review of policies, agencies are adding training and reporting resources, changing their approaches to some business situations, initiating agency-wide discussions and updating their mission and values.\\nCat Colella-Graham, a former HR executive at Cohn & Wolfe, Ruder Finn and other agencies, founded Cheer Partners in 2017. In addition to being a PR shop, Cheer also consults with agencies on HR policies and issues. She’s noticed an increase in people reporting harassment problems and also the recognition by agency leaders that there is a problem. As a result, agencies are changing.\\xa0\\n\"[Agencies] are starting to look critically at their purpose, mission and vision and trying to see how they can really change the narrative about gender to a gender-neutral narrative and including respect and transparency as key items,\" says Colella-Graham.\\xa0\\nChanging the basic operating values of an agency, as opposed to a specific HR policy, is valuable, she says, because \"it’s a great opportunity to say, ‘This is who we are and what we say and how we treat each other and [our] core value is respect.’\"\\nAgencies without procedures for handling harassment are adding them, Colella-Graham says, and others are creating ways to report harassment. Private email addresses and Slack channels are becoming more popular, as are 1-800 numbers so \"someone can feel comfortable dialing in as opposed to talking to a manager,\" she explains.\\xa0\\nColella-Graham also says agencies are adding training for entry-level employees who may be \"socially aware but in practice don’t have tools in their toolkit to deal with this.\" That’s also the case for supervisors \"who may be in a position to witness [harassment] or actual deal with a complaint and have to actually respond to complaints teaching them where to go from there,\" she explains.\\xa0\\nSmaller agencies tend to be more informal about the harassment issue than larger shops, she added, and not just because of their respective budgets. \"Because [large agencies] are so highly visible,\" says Colella-Graham, who counts MWWPR and SourceCode Communications as HR clients, \"they are almost forced to have more structured policies and procedures.\"\\xa0\\nThe boutique agency informality is reflected at tech PR firm Bospar. Principal Curtis Sparrer says that because his agency is smaller, it’s able to tailor work arrangements with clients on a case-by-base basis. However, harassment is definitely a concern, especially in tech PR, he adds.\\xa0\\n\"Tech gets complicated,\" Sparrer explains. \"Because people don’t treat it as a Monday-to-Friday, nine-to-five job. They treat it as if their entire livelihood depends on these interactions, so people are friendly and social with people who are prone to tendencies that might make others feel uncomfortable.\"\\nAs a result, Bospar has added a specific policy to address situations that are fertile ground for compromising scenarios.\\xa0\\n\"We are staffed so that we always have two people attending [events],\" he says. \"So our employees always have a buddy. Generally, when you’re going to an award show or a convention where you have prolonged contact with a client, you have to have a buddy. The system made sense in elementary school and it makes sense here.\"\\nBefore #MeToo, one of the most notable sexual harassment cases took place at a firm with a few dozen employees. In late 2015, Washington-based progressive political PR firm FitzGibbon Media shut down after allegations of sexual harassment and assault were leveled against its president, Trevor FitzGibbon. He was later reportedly cleared of the charges and opened a new firm.\\xa0\\nAs a mid-sized agency, Allison+Partners is mid-way in the formality of its approach to harassment and changes it has made since the start of #MeToo. Global chief talent officer Ashleigh Butson says the agency always had a structured HR approach to harassment. In response to #MeToo, it updated some definitions in policy documents.\\xa0\\nHowever, changes made to its harassment training protocol have been more significant, she says.\\xa0\\n\"What we’ve added are some case studies that give employees the opportunity to talk,\" Butson says. \"There\\'s an opening to talk about the client, or #MeToo, or anything else they want to talk about.\"\\xa0\\nTraining has always been mandatory at the firm, Butson says, but the case studies address situations PR employees often deal with. \"We have to stay by the book,\" she adds. \"But we’ve extended it so people are more aware of the issues.\"\\nThe response of larger agencies has been decidedly more formal and structured, notes Colella-Graham.\\xa0\\nYashica Olden, worldwide executive director of diversity and inclusion at Ogilvy, says that \"since #MeToo, we put together guidelines for our HR business partners around the globe to give more specific guidance on how to handle any complaints or concerns.\"\\n\"[It’s] to provide a corporate viewpoint and to give them more support,\" she explains. \"Most of the time when you’re in New York or Chicago, there are a whole lot of great resources available, but what if you’re sitting in a small office, let’s say the Philippines or Bangladesh? This way, you know what does the company say and how does the company say it and how you should handle the situation, and that’s great because it empowers the HR business partner to respond and react and not to potentially hide a situation.\"\\nOgilvy also gave worldwide chief diversity and inclusion officer Donna Pedro the additional title of chief ethics officer in December 2017, Olden points out.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"Donna reports, and always has reported, directly into the CEOs office, and that helps us ensure there is senior commitment and accountability and alignment on this issue,\" she adds.\\nJames Wright, global chairman of Havas PR Collective and CEO of Havas PR North America, said #MeToo inspired changes at his company. The firm increased regular online harassment and respect training for the entire Havas group, as well as onsite training for individual agencies. It also formalized a mentor program that gives employees someone to talk to outside of their line managers.\\n\"We had policies in place before,\" he says. \"But #MeToo led to reevaluation of where we were. If nothing else, it certainly led to a more regular evaluation of how we are treating each other and responding to each other and hopefully creating an agency environment that welcomes better behavior.\"\\nAt Golin, #MeToo inspired a nine-month effort that started with executives taking a listening tour of offices and ended with a summit focused on employee empowerment. Afterward, Golin rolled out mandatory training for all U.S. employees to help employees manage \"real-life, uncomfortable workplace scenarios.\"\\xa0\\nIt also developed a framework to guide employees on how to recognize and handle harassing behavior. \"We categorized behavior into three different areas,\" says Golin vice chair Ellen Ryan Mardiks. \"Clueless, creepy and criminal.\"\\nClueless behavior includes actions that make people feel a little uncomfortable but might not rise to an egregious level, she notes. Golin employees can decide for themselves if they should contact HR or simply ignore it.\\nBehavior is considered creepy, Ryan Mardiks says, when \"it’s clear there is more going on.\" In that case the framework encourages employees to \"raise it up the flagpole if they feel that needs to [happen].\"\\xa0\\nWhen the behavior fits in the criminal category, Ryan Mardiks explains, it has to be reported. \"In this last category, it’s very clear. The employee is not to handle it by him or herself. It needs to be raised with HR, and then it will be dealt with at that level and resolved.\"\\nHave you registered with us yet?\\nRegister now to enjoy more articles and free email bulletins\\nRegister\\nAlready registered?\\nSign in\\nLatest'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Do Ergonomic Keyboards Really Help? Do Ergonomic Keyboards Really Help?\\nSKIP TO MAIN CONTENT\\nPangea temporary hotfixes here\\nRoll up your sleeves, it’s time to make your typing more ergonomic! But what does that even mean?\\nWhilst comfort is subjective, ergonomics is the study of people’s objective physical wellbeing and performance. Another thing you need to know about ergonomics? It’s a relative concept. That means a device is never 100% or 0% ‘ergo’, but instead simply more ergonomic, or less ergonomic, compared to another one. Lastly, ergonomics is never a ‘one size fits all’ solution. Ergonomic needs and benefits depend on individual scenarios - for example, their physiology, where they work, what they are doing, which tools they use, and for how long. So when you choose a keyboard, it’s important to make sure it’s right for your unique situation.\\nHere’s what to look out for, and how certain features can help you work better and eventually, feel better.\\n#1 SUPPORT YOUR WRISTS\\nAlmost like a little bed for your hands, a pillowed palm rest supports you by placing your forearms slightly higher than your keyboard. This optimized ergonomic position makes typing feel extra comfy. In fact, compared to a traditional Logitech keyboard without a palm rest, Wave Keys and ERGO K860 offer over 50% more palm support.*as compared to a traditional Logitech keyboard without palm rest\\n#2 IMPROVE YOUR TYPING POSTURE\\nA curved, split keyframe places your hands, wrists and forearms in a more natural posture as you type. From the moment your hands land on the keyboard you’ll notice a sense of relaxation - and that’s because the sloping form and angled keys are reducing muscle strain on your wrists and forearms. Complemented by the effects of the cushioned palm rest, you’ve got all the ingredients you need to feel and work better.\\n“Research at the University of Washington has shown that keyboards with the keys curved to match the natural triangle—formed by the left and right hands—improve wrist posture. In addition, the research has shown that wrist rests can also help your hands type in a more relaxed and natural position. Health professionals often prefer ergonomic keyboards since they better match the complex geometry of our bodies and put less strain on our muscles, compared to conventional, rectangular keyboards.”\\nPeter Johnson's face photo\\nPeter Johnson, PhD\\nUniversity of Washington - Professor Emeritus - Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Member of the Logi Ergo Lab Advisory Board\\n#3 TESTED BY USERS.

The workers have been on strike since July, when they joined screenwriters on their strike. Now, if the performers approve their new deal, Hollywood may soon come to life again.\\nOutside Fox studios in Los Angeles, production assistant Allie Palm and SAG-AFTRA actress Desiree Woolfolk say they can\\'t wait to get back to work. Mandalit del Barco/NPR hide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nMandalit del Barco/NPR\\nOutside Fox studios in Los Angeles, production assistant Allie Palm and SAG-AFTRA actress Desiree Woolfolk say they can\\'t wait to get back to work.\\nMandalit del Barco/NPR\\n\"We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. As of 12:01 a.m. PT on Nov. 9, our strike is officially suspended and all picket locations are closed,\" the union said in a statement.\\n\"In a contract valued at over one billion dollars,\" it continued, \"we have achieved a deal... that includes \"above-pattern\" minimum compensation increases, unprecedented provisions for consent and compensation that will protect members from the threat of AI, and for the first time establishes a streaming participation bonus.\" More details will be available in the coming days.\\nNOTE: Note: NPR News staffers are also members of SAG-AFTRA, but broadcast journalists are under a different contract and we are not on strike.\\nThe contract still needs to be ratified by the union\\'s 160,000 members. They\\'ve been on picket lines outside studios in Los Angeles, New York and other cities since initial contract negotiations broke down (several times) with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.\\nThe union had been asking for an 11 percent wage increase, higher residuals tied to the success of streaming shows, better healthcare and retirement benefits. It also wanted an end to the practice of having actors pay for their own self-recorded auditions.\\nReportedly, one of the final sticking points was key for performers: protections from the use of artificial intelligence by the studios and streamers; Actors, for instance, want control over their likeness on screen, so they don\\'t get replicated without their permission or compensation. Background actors have also complained that studios have asked to scan their bodies so they can be copied and pasted into big crowd scenes without having to pay them more or hire more actors.\\nHours before the deal was finally made, Warner Brothers Discovery CEO David Zaslav talked to investors about the negotiations.\\n\"We made a last and final offer, which met virtually all of the union\\'s goals and includes the highest wage increase in 40 years and believe it provides for a positive outcome for all involved,\" he said during the company\\'s third quarter earnings call. \"We recognize that we need our creative partners to feel valued and rewarded and look forward to both sides getting back to the business of telling great stories.\"\\nMany of the demands were similar to those made by members of the Writers Guild of America, which began its strike in May. Screenwriters declared victory when they finally got a deal with the studios and streamers nearly five months later. For the first time, Netflix and other streaming companies agreed to be transparent about their viewership data, allowing writers to get higher residuals when shows are successful. And the AMPTP agreed to language protecting writers from the use of AI in the writing process, giving them credit for their work and allowing writers to determine if their writing can be used to train AI.\\nWGA negotiators were so confident the writers would approve the deal, they ended their strike on September 27, and allowed writers to resume working before they ratified their contract. Many of them continued to support the actors on the picket lines.\\n\"We\\'re super grateful, especially to the WGA members who came out with us even after they got their deal,\" said actor Margarita Franco, on the picket line outside Fox Studios on Wednesday. \"It\\'s been a hard. A lot of people are struggling financially, especially the below the line people... Since 1984, I\\'ve been a working class actress and I\\'ve made a living doing this. I\\'m a single mom. I was able to make a living until the last couple of years, when the streamers kind of came into the picture. And then I had to get like two to three side hustles. This labor movement is starting because people are tired of not making enough to live, to survive.\"\\nHollywood\\'s double strikes shut down almost all productions (except some independent films and TV shows not affiliated with the AMPTP that agreed to higher pay and protections). Nearly everyone in front of and behind the cameras has been out of work for months, though other union members supported the strike. Without actors to promote their work, studios delayed many film and TV series premieres.\\nNegotiations proved to be contentious; studio executives at first appeared to be unwilling to compromise. Meanwhile, actors and writers complained about not being able to make livable wages and said they wanted to share in some of the profits. After Disney CEO Bob Iger went on TV saying the writers were \"not being realistic\" in their demands, SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher called him an \"ignoramus.\"\\n\"We are the victims here. We are being victimized by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us,\" Drescher said during a memorable press conference announcing the strike. Until then, she had been best known for her starring role in the 1990s TV series The Nanny. \"I cannot believe it, quite frankly: How far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they\\'re losing money left and right, when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them.\"\\nIger later softened his rhetoric, telling investors on an earnings call that \"Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community. That includes actors, writers, animators, directors and producers,\" Iger said. \"I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry. And it is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months. And I am personally committed to working to achieve this result.\"\\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos also said the studios and streamers wanted to end the strike quickly. But he said they broke away from negotiations in October, because of a proposal by SAG-AFTRA that he deemed \"a bridge too far.\" The union had asked streamers to redistribute the wealth by paying performers 57 cents per subscription every year.\\n\"When you introduce an unprecedented business model like they did on all of my members with streaming, an unprecedented compensation structure must also go along with it,\" Drescher explained. \"We have cracked the code on something. We have identified what the flaw is in this streaming model with regards to compensation. It may not be easy, it may not be what they want, but it is an elegant way to solve the problem. So we can all go back to work in what would become the new normal.\"\\nIt\\'s not clear yet if that proposal made it into the final deal. In the final weeks, actor George Clooney, Ben Affleck, Emma Stone, Tyler Perry and other A- listers got involved, hoping to end the strike. They suggested high paid actors give $150 million to the performers to pay for their benefits — an idea Drescher and the union lawyers quickly shot down. \"It\\'s apples and oranges,\" she said, adding that only employers can pay for workers benefits. Still, she said, the gesture was appreciated.\\nPicket signs outside SONY studios in Culver City Mandalit del Barco/NPR News hide caption\\ntoggle caption\\nMandalit del Barco/NPR News\\nPicket signs outside SONY studios in Culver City\\nMandalit del Barco/NPR News\\nNow that writers are back in business, late night and daytime talk shows are back on the air, as is Saturday Night Live. Some showrunners have gotten back their overall deals, and many hope there will be new scripted TV shows next season. Once SAG-AFTRA members approve this new contract, production in TV and movies could resume, meaning all those other people in front of and behind the scenes will be working once again.\\nHours before the deal was announced, actors were still on the picket lines.\\n\"The studios, the CEOs, at the end of the day, they don\\'t care one way or the other. If they cared, we would never have gone on strike,\" said SAG-AFTRA strike captain Kimberly Westbrook.\\nAnother strike captain, Chelsea Schwartz, said she\\'s looking forward to back to work, but she said \"How do you go from being so angry at these people to being, like \\'and we\\'re best buds now, working together on set.\\' We forgive, but you don\\'t forget.\"'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Pediatric GI and Hepatology : Gastritis : Gastritis Introduction : Diseases and Conditions | Pediatric Oncall\\n Gastritis\\nHimali Meshram\\nMD Pediatrics, MUHS Fellowship in Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology\\nConsultant Pediatric Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist, Apollo Clinic, Nagpur, India.\\nFirst Created: 09/07/2020\\xa0 Last Updated: 09/07/2020\\nDefinition\\nGastritis is defined as inflammation of the mucosal protective lining of the stomach. It develops when the gastric lining becomes thin or damaged and it comes in contact with hydrochloric acid secreted by the stomach.1\\nTypes\\nIt could be acute or chronic. Acute gastritis involves sudden and severe inflammation of the stomach lining while chronic gastritis involves long term mucosal inflammation which can even last for years.1\\nClassification of Gastritis\\nThe mucosal disorders of stomach can be classified based on endoscopic features into erosive and non-erosive as follows:2\\nErosive and/or hemorrhagic Gastritis\\nStress induced\\nTraumatic\\nNSAID induced\\nPortal hypertensive gastropathy\\nCorrosive\\nRadiation induced\\nNon erosive Gastritis\\nHelicobacter pylori gastritis\\nAllergic\\nEosinophilic gastritis\\nCrohn’s gastritis\\nCeliac gastritis\\nPernicious anemia\\nRisk factors\\nThere are various risk factors that account for gastritis including Helicobacter pylori infection, use of NSAIDs, stress, smoking, spicy food, etc.1 H. pylori is one of the important risk factors for acute and chronic gastritis. Low socioeconomic status, poor environmental hygiene, and cooking habits, etc are various factors that determine the likelihood to acquire the H. pylori infection in the childhood.3 H. pylori has also been associated with peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and MALToma. The burden of H. pylori infection is highest in developing countries like India.4\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of acute gastritis include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, belching, bloated stomach.\\nChronic gastritis have mild or no symptoms.\\nDiagnosis of H. pylori gastritis\\nUrea breath test5\\nIt is a non- invasive test and used to diagnose H. pylori infection. However it is difficult to perform in children. Patient is given a drink containing solution C14 containing urea. If H. pylori is present in the stomach, its urease enzyme will hydrolyse ammonia into water and CO2. The labelled carbon is thus exhaled in breath and measured.\\nSerological testing of IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori in blood, urine or saliva is not for clinical purposes.6\\nUpper-GI endoscopy6:\\nIt is preferred in patients with suspected ulcer disease or gastritis.\\nIt can detect presence of ulcers, bleeding.\\nPerforming rapid urease test (RUT) on gastric mucosa for detecting H. pylori infection has sensitivity is of 75%–100%. RUT is easy, fast, inexpensive, and widely available, but limited with false positive results and affected with drugs.\\nHistopathological evaluation-\\nIt is considered gold standard to demonstrate H. pylori in the biopsy specimen. Histopathologically, H. pylori is seen as short, curved, or spiral bacilli resting on the epithelial surface or in the mucus layer of gastric mucosa.\\nCulture\\nH. pylori is difficult to grow in culture medium, hence role of culture in diagnosis is limited.4\\nTREATMENT\\nIf it is noticed that certain food items or stress, make the symptoms worse. Changing diet, lifestyle changes, and reducing stress can be helpful. NSAIDs and other drugs related ulcers are treated by stopping the causative medications and administering drugs that promote healing of the stomach lining.\\nMedical treatment\\nGastritis is treated with acid-lowering drugs like-\\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) -omeprazole or pantoprazole.\\nH2 blockers - ranitidine or famotidine.\\nAntacids like aluminium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide neutralize the acid in stomach.\\nRecommended therapies for H. pylori infection:\\n6\\nTriple therapy regimen\\nProton pump inhibitor (PPI) (1-2 mg/kg/day) for 14 days,\\nAmpicillin (50 mg/kg/day) for 14 days,\\nClarithromycin (20 mg/kg/day), or metronidazole (20 mg/kg/day) for 14 days.\\nQuadruple therapy:\\nProton pump inhibitor (PPI) (1-2 mg/kg/day) for 10-14 days,\\nbismuth subsalicylate (8 mg/kg/day) for 10-14 days,\\nAmpicillin (50 mg/kg/day) for 10-14 days, and\\nMetronidazole (20 mg/kg/day) for 10-14 days\\nSequential therapy:\\nPPI (1-2 mg/kg/day), Ampicillin (50 mg/kg/day) for 5 days,\\nthen PPI (1-2 mg/kg/day), Clarithromycin (20 mg/kg/day), and metronidazole (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 days.\\nComplications of H. pylori infection\\nThe major complications include gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (duodenal and gastric).\\n5\\nAtrophic gastritis with or without metaplasia have also been described in children.\\nGastric adenocarcinoma are rare.\\nH. pylori has been associated with growth retardation and anemia.\\n1.

With minimal space requirements, the PX-770 offers a digital piano for home with sophisticated functionality.\\nThe new PX-770 also features the Concert Play function: for ten orchestral pieces with piano, you can practice and interpret the piano part.\\nSynthetic Ebony and Ivory Texture\\nThe elegant keyboard design offers the same luxurious tactile and visual qualities as real ebony and ivory. The carefully roughened surface texture prevents fingers from slipping even during extended playing.\\nMultidimensional AiR Sound Generation\\nAiR stands for \"Acoustic and intelligent Resonator\" and refers to CASIO\\'s newly developed multidimensional sound generation. This sound engine, combined with other innovations, forms the core of the new digital piano technology. The result is an unprecedented, lifelike digital reproduction of the playing and tonal behavior of a grand piano.\\nLayer\\nThis function allows two tones to be layered, for example combining a soft grand piano sound with strings. Perfect for ballads and slow, romantic pieces!\\nSplit\\nSplit lets you divide the keyboard into two zones, e.g., bass on the left hand and piano or vibraphone on the right for swing and jazz.\\nReverb Simulator\\nThe reverb simulator is a high-quality digital effect that, through elaborate simulation, can realistically and naturally reproduce the special acoustic environments of selected famous halls, concert venues, cathedrals, and arenas.\\nHammer Response\\nThe specific playing feel of a piano also arises from the time delay between key press and string sound. The size and mass of the hammer heads and the time until they strike the strings are directly related to pitch and key velocity. This mechanical characteristic of an acoustic instrument is precisely recreated by CASIO\\'s \"Hammer Response\" technology.\\nString Resonance\\nCASIO\\'s unique string resonance system provides an accurate simulation of the sympathetic vibrations and interactions of all 88 piano strings. Additionally, nuances produced by pressing the damper pedal (\"damper resonance\") are authentically reproduced.\\nWith the PX-770, your living room becomes a concert hall!\\nFeatures\\nNew Grand Piano Sound 1\\n18 additional tones\\nMultidimensional AiR sound generation (128-note polyphony)\\nTri-sensor Scaled Hammer Action Keyboard II\\n\"Ivory Touch\" keyboard with ebony and ivory finish\\nMetronome\\nLayer, split, duet modes\\nDamper resonance\\nHammer response\\nUSB interface (To Host)\\n2 headphone outputs\\nNew design\\nKeyboard\\nNumber of keys: 88\\nMechanism: Tri-sensor Scaled Hammer Action Keyboard II\\nKey surface: synthetic ebony and ivory texture\\nTouch sensitivity: 3 sensitivity levels, off\\nTones\\nPolyphony (max.): 128\\nNumber of tones: 19 tones\\nSound generation: Multi-Dimensional Morphing AiR\\nLayer/Split/Duet: Yes/Yes/Yes\\nAcoustic simulator\\nHammer response\\nDamper resonance\\nEffects\\nReverb (4)\\nChorus (4)\\nBrilliance (-3 ~ 0 ~ 3)\\nDSP\\nMusic library\\nNumber of built-in pieces: 60\\nUser songs: 10 songs (max), 90 KB/song\\nAdditional Features\\nOctave shift: ±12 octaves\\nMetronome: beats per measure: 0 to 9, tempo range: 20 to 255\\nPedals: 3 pedals (damper, soft, sostenuto)\\nHalf-pedal function\\nTranspose: 2 octaves (-12 to 0 to +12)\\nTuning: A4 = 415.5 Hz ~ 440.0 Hz ~ 465.9 Hz\\nScale function: 17 temperaments\\nKey lock: yes\\nConnections and memory\\nHeadphone/output (stereo jack x 2)\\nUSB port (Type B)\\nSpeakers—size: 12 cm x 2\\nAmplifier power: 8 W + 8 W\\nDimensions (W x D x H): 1,391 x 299 x 798 mm (without music stand)\\nWeight: 31.5 kg (without music stand)\\nScope of delivery\\n1 x Casio PX-770 WE Privia Digital Piano White\\n1 x Power adapter\\n1 x Music stand\\nSpecification\\nProduct number 00051052\\nLesson function No\\nmax. polyphony 128\\nAuto accompaniment No\\nNumber of Keys 88\\nColour White\\nAmplifier power RMS (Watts) 16\\nDisplay No\\nIntegrated speakers Yes\\nNumber of pedals 3\\nKeyboard cover Yes\\nAccessories included No\\nUSB to host Yes\\nRecording function No\\nHeadphones out Yes\\nMidi interface No\\nNumber of styles 0\\nWooden keys No\\nUSB to device No\\nFinish Satin\\nNumber of voices 19\\nConsole No\\nPerson responsible for the EU\\nCASIO Europe GmbH\\nCasio Platz 1\\nDE-22848 Norderstedt\\ninfo@casio.de\\nReviews\\n5.0/5.0\\nBased On 1 ratings\\n5 Stars\\n1\\n4 Stars\\n0\\n3 Stars\\n0\\n2 Stars\\n0\\n1 Star\\n0\\nA verification of the ratings has taken place as follows: Only customers who are registered in our online store and have actually purchased the product from us can submit a rating for the item in the customer account.\\nEverything went smoothly!\\nReview from Kevin on 14.10.2021\\nVariant Casio PX-770 BK Privia Digital Piano Black\\nThis rating has been translated automatically.

       "  'text': 'Polypharmacy Poisoning, Dependence and Recovery from the Psychiatric Paradigm - Mad In America Polypharmacy Poisoning, Dependence and Recovery from the Psychiatric Paradigm\\n54\\n1120\\nA little over eight years ago, I voluntarily signed myself into a psychiatric hospital for medication management as I could not get in to see a psychiatrist for months. A year prior, I’d gone off of two antidepressants too quickly. After an exhausting year of SSRI withdrawal, job loss and coming out of the closet, I was looking to drugs once again to solve basic life and health problems, just as I had at twenty-one while coping with the effects of childhood trauma and a bout of Lyme disease.\\nBeing a passionate, fairly intelligent and compassionate Aries, one of my mottos has always been “No regrets.” But while I’ve come to accept and even at times rejoice in the rewards that my life-altering experience in the psychiatric system has given me, I do deeply regret signing myself into hospital. That one act opened up a door to the most profound hell-on-earth experience that I believe I will ever endure: benzodiazepine withdrawal.\\nHad I accepted a prescription for Ativan as an outpatient, I would have had access to the pharmacy print out and refused to take it for more than a week, owing to benzodiazepine’s addictive nature. But I didn’t have the print-outs locked up, even though I asked for them, and my self-esteem was being eroded by professionals who were profoundly committed to the idea that medicalizing extreme moods or thoughts is helpful to their patients. One nurse, to her credit, did say to me, “You’re an artist. You might have mood swings your entire life. You feel life deeply. You don’t need drugs for that”.\\nOn a gut level, I believed her, but I had been trained to distrust my mind and was in considerable pain. The drug commercials continued to play through my head, and despite my\\xa0higher wisdom,\\xa0I continued my search for the “right” mood altering chemicals, still holding out some hope they were actually medicine. At that time, I was coming out as gay. I was in SSRI withdrawal. I was unemployed. This conflagration of events and realities would precipitate a change in role for me over the course of three years from social worker to psychiatric patient.\\nAlthough I began titration two months out of hospital release, because of the number of drugs they’d put me on and my fifteen-year dependence on antidepressants, the withdrawal would take twenty-two months. It would include two more hospitalizations for medical reasons, a partial hospitalization program, homelessness, a near death experience, cognitive dementia so extreme I would forget to shower for days on end and when I showered, would forget to use soap, as well as a wasting syndrome that would take me to the brink of a heart attack at eighty-three pounds.\\nI have recently published the story of what followed that first hospitalization in my book, Losing the Plot: A Journey Away from Psychiatry. In it, you won’t read that psychiatry is doing its best or that the clinicians who receive large kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies mean well; my book is a scathing critique of the industry from the inside out and outside in. My skepticism of the industry began years before my hospitalization, while I was a social worker who promoted an “anti-stigma” message to over-drugged, poverty-stricken individuals close to comatose from sedative mixtures in continuing day treatment programs, encouraging them to “self-care”, which meant of course to take those drugs. As any ethical person would, I began listening to that still small voice in myself and the sick-to-my-stomach feeling I was getting from my work. That is really when the departure from psychiatry began, but I’d dive in deep first, as any good researcher, to fully test the waters. Just like most of their drug trials, my long-term version of the experiment failed miserably.\\nWhile I have an incredible distrust for the psychiatric system, I do say that psychiatry healed me in spite of itself. Besides Lyme disease and a fairly dysfunctional upbringing with two Vietnam veteran parents, one of the main reasons I constantly sought help in the psychiatric system was because of a hefty dose of self-doubt. I wasn’t ok enough in my eyes, something was wrong with me. I didn’t even know what, but something, and having grown up in a medical family, I reasoned medicine—even half-hearted and experimental medicine—must be the answer. It took surviving all of the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including derealization, gastritis, auditory hallucinations, wasting, dementia, panic attacks and profound depression, for me to come to understand that not only had I really been a cool person before all that shit, but also that nothing was wrong with me. I was smart and a little neurotic at times, but that was it. Drugs caused me to be mentally ill where I had not been before.\\nYes, I had struggled as a child and through periods of high stress in adulthood with what some would label anxiety or depression, but all of those episodes had pretty big explanations, like post traumatic stress and coming out of the closet. Overall, my life was pretty grand compared to full-scale, chemically-induced psychosis. I had a lot of friends, in part because I was so anxious and concerned over my relationships. I was deeply interested in ethics and personal growth, excelled in school, found solace and contentment in nature and music, was a dedicated and hard worker, writer and director. I coped well with chronic pain and so I had a well of compassion at my disposal in my work with people with disabilities. I did get down, but those are often the cards you’re dealt when raised by two Vietnam vets and living with chronic pain. I never needed the drugs, ever, even when I felt they were helping me.\\nMy book outlines the many problems inherent in diagnosing and drugging en masse the American population, but because it was written only a year or two after I got off of everything, it does not get into my life now much, or the spiritual rewards of rugged warriorship, which are many. I have been off of all medicine for five and a half years, and have been working for almost five, the last four full-time. I am again in social work, though now in the benefits management vs. “take your drugs” role. I am taking prerequisites toward medical school, just transcended my first plateau in learning the guitar for my songwriting, and for the first time am submitting my poetry for publication (it’s getting accepted, too.) I am also out in nature doing things the rheumatologist I had at fifteen may have never expected me to do, like backpacking.\\nLife has brought many challenges the past five and a half years, like incredible debt I still struggle with and other things unrelated to the drugging, but I go outside and garden, play with my spaniel mutt, cook a nice stir fry, complain about my job, love my job, attend women’s circles, drumming circles, spiritual retreats, wear fuzzy socks to bed in the winter. In short, I live life. As those with means are fortunate to do, I consider none of it therapy. It’s just life, with all its beauty and despair, best lived fully and unapologetically, except when apology is needed, for the short time we are here.\\nI would say that I meditate and do yoga, and I have joined a Buddhist sangha and have taken yoga classes, but if I learned anything from my rendezvous with psychiatry, it is that no one pill or religion or cultural icon has the answer for life’s conundrums, or is a panacea to the reality that all of us eventually get sick and die. I have vowed not to become a new age priestess yielding an arsenal of ‘shoulds’ and ‘have tos’ related to personal growth and sitting in lotus position. In fact I have learned that, among other actual physical illnesses, I have a genetic mutation that causes me to improperly process folic acid. Low folate contributes to anxiety and chronic pain, so my inability to sit still for meditation has been a function of this actual physical illness.\\nI’m not here to claim mind over matter. Folks who hallucinate or obsess or want to kill themselves are either likely enduring/recovering from trauma and/or physically ill. Some of them are psychics and shamans, yes, but I know first-hand, from a drug-induced experience, that real hardcore horrible psychosis exists. Yet despite the numerical diagnoses in the DSM like 317.5 or whatever, the lack of specificity in pinpointing the causes for such phenomena in psychiatry is stunning. Each person’s brain, body and journey, are unique. The “pick 5 of 9” symptoms from this checklist method of diagnostics is, scientifically, horrifying. And the idea that some shading or lighting on an MRI can be accurate enough to induct someone into the psychiatric paradigm is equally baffling. How scary if our brains all lit up the same on an MRI! How frightening if we all believed and felt exactly the same; what would be left to discuss?\\nThe critique I make of psychiatry is comprehensive. The experience I endured, along with many others, is damning of the way the profession currently operates. At the very least, the question of “Why psychiatry?” needs to be asked.\\nWhen I stopped seeing psychiatry as a viable resource, it stopped being a backup plan. When it was no longer a backup plan, I suddenly no longer needed it. But first and foremost, when I stopped thinking something was wrong with me, I already no longer needed psychiatry.\\nLosing the Plot documents the steps I had to take to leave psychiatry behind, including some details on tapering antidepressants, Lithium and benzodiazepines. It also provides snippets of my life as social worker before the drugging. It touches briefly on some family history, including the untreated mental health struggles of my mother (which might make anyone a believer in psychiatry, except that in retrospect, I am very glad she never did enter a hospital or take an antipsychotic.) And lastly, it leaves the reader with four possible future renditions of my life, none of which are under the auspices of psychiatry but each of which includes the continued influence of psychiatry, as all of our lives do. It begs the following questions: Is happily ever after realistic, preferable and for our highest good? Is Hollywood’s instant gratification narrative, which psychiatry relies on to sell drugs, the best story to live? Or is working through and being present with the grief, the visions, the tremors, and the uncertainty of our days a better prescription for a long and fulfilling life?\\n***\\nMad in America hosts blogs by a diverse group of writers. These posts are designed to serve as a public forum for a discussion—broadly speaking—of psychiatry and its treatments. The opinions expressed are the writers’ own.\\n54 COMMENTS\\nBest of luck with your book. My story’s different – it’s the story of the typical misdiagnosis of antidepressant withdrawal syndrome as bipolar, during the DSM-IV-TR, when that was still considered inappropriate. But, it too, is the story of the insane stupidity of the bio-bio-bio psychiatric system.\\nIt took me much longer than you, to research the ‘system,’ since I was not initially in it myself, but had also been propagandized to trust in doctors. But I’m working on my book, finally. I was initially drugged for claiming God was inspiring a story in 2001. Now I’ve got it, and am working on my book. It’s a story of harm to millions of children, not just me, which did truly disgust me, and I’m still working through my disgust at the almost unfathomable betrayal of society by today’s psychiatric industry.\\nIt does strike me that the psycho / pharmaceutical industries’ complete and total disrespect for the artist communities in recent years may result in tons of “artwork” about their crimes against us. I already see that going on in my community in local art shows.\\nMy best to you with your book. And on your healing journey.\\nReport comment\\nFrom my book, “Nothing is more important when attempting to silence dissent as getting a community’s artists to turn In on themselves. No social change happens, just artwork on ‘bipolar disorder’.”\\nPlease get your book out there.\\nReport comment\\nThank you for the encouragement, I’m working on it. And I have a lot of “bipolar” / actual “central symptoms of neuroleptic induced anticholinergic intoxication syndrome” artwork showing the iatrogenic hell of the psych drugs, and then the drug withdrawal induced mania that occurs while recovering. And, hopefully, our books can some day help to bring about the apparently much needed social change.\\nReport comment\\nAnticholinergic intoxication syndrome is a type of “Polypharmacy Poisoning.” The central symptoms are almost identical to the symptoms of schizophrenia. It’s how unethical or misinformed psychiatrists / doctors create the bipolar / schizophrenia symptoms in patients with their neuroleptics / antipsychotics, and other anticholinergic agents, for profit.\\nGiven all the polypharmacy going on within the psychiatric industry today, because the psychiatrists have delusions their new drugs are “safe” and “wonder drugs,” I would imaging it’s highly likely most schizophrenia today is actually anticholinergic intoxication syndrome, misdiagnosed as schizophrenia, or in my case bipolar. From drugs.com:\\n“Agents with anticholinergic properties (e.g., sedating antihistamines; antispasmodics; neuroleptics; phenothiazines; skeletal muscle relaxants; tricyclic antidepressants; disopyramide) may have additive effects when used in combination. Excessive parasympatholytic effects may result in paralytic ileus, hyperthermia, heat stroke, and the anticholinergic intoxication syndrome. Peripheral symptoms of intoxication commonly include mydriasis, blurred vision, flushed face, fever, dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, urinary retention, and constipation. Central symptoms may include memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, hallucinations, psychosis, delirium, hyperactivity, twitching or jerking movements, stereotypy, and seizures.”\\nAs to a class action lawsuit, I believe it’s actually legal for any doctor to prescribe any ‘medication’ for any reason they please currently in the US, so I don’t think a lawsuit would be possible. But I do think the medical community has been given too much power, and the right to force these toxic drugs onto people needs to be taken from the medical community.\\nSince I know, first hand, some doctors are abusing this power. I had the misfortune of being medically unnecessarily shipped to a Dr. V R Kuchipudi, who was arrested by the FBI, seven years later, for doing the same thing he did to me, to lots of patients (in my case his purpose was to cover up prior easily recognized medical mistakes for prior doctors):\\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fusao%2Filn%2Fpr%2Fchicago%2F2013%2Fpr0416_01a.pdf&ei=g6YvVduoA4HQgwTB1IGgDw&usg=AFQjCNFZUC8OxCVtnXcVlirFEgjgYoUTTA&bvm=bv.91071109,d.eXY\\nReport comment\\n5parts,\\nThese drugs cause so many horrific conditions. Class action lawsuits against the companies are difficult to launch b/c the pharm industry argues that controlling “mental illness” has higher priority than inducing physical. For example, no good class action has been brought against the makers of the shorter half life benzos, though not for my lack of trying not the medical records of thousands I assure you, but the financial risk/ratio is something no lawyer I know will yet take on.\\nWhen I sought my own lawsuit, because my recovery took longer than the statute of limitations, no lawyer would look at my case, even to advocate for an extension of the statute owing to my health. Point blank I es told I had the evidence but the cost to launch the suit against these major companies and hospitals would not be enough profit for them. Despite losing two years of my life and income and all of my belongings, they told me I was lucky to get out alive and that I healed myself physically that I should take that as my victory and not look back. I still wonder about that, and do believe if I develop any conditions in the future associated with the poisoning, which would reopen the statute, that I will sue.\\nBest to you\\nReport comment\\nSo much of this is like my story.\\nI don’t know where I first read the word “pharmacaust” to describe the Psychopharmacuitical holocaust that is the mass drugging by psychiatry but there is no other one word to describe it.\\nI am told my insomnia is a symptom of depression and of course like many people I believed the big lie that depression was caused by low serotonin and started those first pills, this crap called Serzone.\\nThen Xanax, and that did work to put me to sleep but that walk in doctor was moving on to work at a hospital and sent me to psychiatrist .\\nXanax 1mg to sleep is bad.

Most all of us were taught in childhood to blindly trust doctors and other authority figures. There is no need to be so hard on yourself.\\nFurthermore, these pills typically cause what Dr. Peter Breggin refers to as the “spellbinding” effect, in which a person in unable to realize the drugs are actually doing more harm than good, and they are really causing: apathy, decreased empathy and creativity, impaired judgement, mania, etc. We can’t perceive this is happening, and instead often believe we are functioning at a very high level.\\nReport comment\\nSorry to say this – But the question has to be asked, & it applies to a lot of people – If there was nothing really wrong with you to begin with, then why did you seek out psychiatric treatments, & take all the medications?\\nWhat about the people that are severely mentally unwell?\\nPart of the problem with all this pro/anti-psychiatry debate is that 80% or more of people seeking psychiatric treatment & medication are the worried well – there is nothing wrong with them.

Firstly, in answer to your question, it’s none of your business. But since you asked it on a public site I will attempt an answer.\\nWhether anything was “wrong” with me or not actually has nothing to do with the medical malpractice that happened to me, and countless others. At the end of the drug withdrawal I was administered an mmpi and could have been diagnosed with 25 different things. One year later, sober, took the test again, nada.\\nSecondly, again, although my personal medical history before the medical malpractice is irrelevant to the torture I endured on psychopharmaceuticals, I was actually first administered a tricyclic for sleep disturbance owing to the effects of chronic Lyme’s disease at 15.\\nI like what you’ve done there with the shaming, though, good show. It’s almost as if I’m back sitting in a psychiatrist’s office… Unfortunately, for you, research bares out that these drugs are prescribed to people with physical health issues or situational anxieties/depressions repeatedly. I will let this site’s research do the talking on that one and refuse to engage any longer with any hecklers.\\nReport comment\\n“Whether anything was “wrong” with me or not actually has nothing to do with the medical malpractice that happened to me, and countless others.”\\nHow is it nothing to do with anyone?

As if the users were somehow intentionally violating some social agreement or contract by seeking these services?\\nClearly, you have not watched the myriad ads nor ready the many news articles letting everyone know that “depression is a disease just like diabetes” and implying that treatment is for everyone. The message that “no one has to suffer” is clearly out there for one and all to see, and we are supposed to trust doctors to know whether we need the given prescription or not. It is the DOCTORS’ lack of ethics that lead a person to be misdiagnosed and forcibly “treated” with something that is either of no use or destructive. For instance, should the doctor not have said that Benzos are addictive and that using them more than a week leads to severe withdrawal reactions? Or is it “caveat emptor,” where the poor patient is forced to look up every drug personally or suffer the consequences? Of course, I know that “caveat emptor” is totally the current reality, but do you really blame the victim for being duped by the guys who are supposed to be telling her the straight scoop?\\nThe main reason the “worried well” are getting so much “treatment” is because psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry have sold us on the idea that we all need drugs any time we feel badly. We are supposed to trust doctors to tell US if there is “something wrong with us.” We shouldn’t have to avoid checking in with our physician for the fear they’ll prescribe us something addictive or deadly in the name of “treatment” without even bothering to tell us what the dangers are.\\n— Steve\\nP.S.

Am currently sat with a 700 book collection mainly on the subjects of the self. i know more on it all than anyone else i know – & i say that humbly.\\ni’ve spent over 30 years researching these areas at depth & have spent over 30 years dealing with the psychiatric/mental health system, with my own condition – & exploring all the alternatives (as far as possible).\\nNeither ‘side’ is right imo. There needs to be a far more comprehensive approach across the board. i have however learnt a bitter lesson, that the masses are just as much to blame as the system & psychiatry.\\nThere is a very valid role for a wise use of pharmacology in the treatment of mental illness, as part of an ideal comprehensive approach to care. i’m Not anti-medication – Nor am i anti a more comprehensive psychiatry. Even with an ideal system, imo some people, albeit a minority, would likely still best be helped with medications.\\nThe fact remains that some people are mentally & emotionally ill, in various ways & to various degrees – some severely. imo 80% or more people currently involved with psychiatry, especially currently, there is nothing really much wrong with them – & there is a personal responsibility with those people, at least in part, as to what treatments they receive.\\ni’ve heard the story far too many times, of people getting medication free, & rallying against psychiatry – where i’d seriously question what was actually wrong to begin with?\\ni’ll say it again – what about the people with a severe mental illness? Not the worried well.\\nReport comment\\nCpuusage,\\nYou say: “… a large part of the difficulties would be resolved if the worried well stopped seeking psychiatric treatment to begin with.” I agree that society would be better off if most people stayed away from psychiatrists, but institutional psychiatry must stop pathologizing normal human behavior (grief, shyness, etc.). People, and most tragically, children, end up on psychiatric medications because of conditions like depression, anxiety or inattention and thanks to “medical intervention,” they end up labeled as bipolar or schizophrenic, leading to further drugging. And if/when they figure it out and try to withdraw from their meds, all hell breaks loose. No one would tell an alcoholic or a user of recreational drugs “you are relapsing because your system needs more alcohol or street drugs,” but that’s exactly what the majority of psychiatrists will say to people experiencing withdrawal psychosis or other distress. So quite a few (though not all) who suffer from serious psychiatric disturbances suffer iatrogenic injury; something relatively manageable that could have been addressed with psychosocial support, diet, nutrients or good healing practices (yoga, meditation, etc.) leads to disabling mental illness. So what do we do for those who suffer serious mental illness? I have seen orthomolecular (nutrient) therapy work wonders, and if it were up to me, that would be the default treatment.\\nReport comment\\ni agree – it’s a failed society/system – i personally lay the blame for that just as much with the masses as i do psychiatry – it’s a collective problem imo.\\nIn the vast majority of cases could we better help people? Yes, i am sure of it – imo over 80% of people currently under the psychiatric system i believe could be cured, or at least maintained at a high degree of wellness without medication.\\nBut it’s Not all the same stuff – cases are individual – a minority of people are suffering from genuinely severe cases of extreme mental illness – that is the facts of it – & i don’t think that there are any easy answers, even with a more ideal society/system as to how best to help them. i disagree that orthomolecular therapy is the solution in all cases, far from it.\\nEven with a more ideal society & system, i’d still see a place for front line mental health services & medications.\\nMy personal opinion – the less severe cases are doing a great disservice to those more genuinely afflicted. That is just my opinion.\\ni think there is also a lot of difference between the US & UK & other countries in relation to all these matters.\\nReport comment\\nCpuusage,\\nYou say ” i disagree that orthomolecular therapy is the solution in all cases.” I did not say (and would never say) that anything is the solution in all cases. I did say and affirm that I have seen orthomolecular therapy work wonders and I would make that the default option. Try that first. Although I do not agree with most of the comments leveled at you, I understand that people have been badly hurt by the system (and I believe the U.S. system is much more brutal and degrading than what you experience in the U.K.), and that stirs a lot of passion. To my way of thinking, you are definitely not a troll and you raise a valid question: what does one do for people with severe symptoms for whom nothing else works? I can accept that for some people, drugs may be the answer (there are psychiatrists posting on MIA who do not like drugs but still use them); but I would still go to the end of earth to avoid them. By the way, when I extol the wonders of nutrient therapy, I am referring to the treatment protocol developed by William Walsh.

All said & done, for people in genuine psychosis, anti-psychotic medication generally works.\\ni’ve been badly hurt & bitten by the system. i disagree with the current system, but i do think it’s a very complex issue. Society has created the way everything is – the mental health system is direct a reflection/mechanism of society – the majority of people want it all, & want it the way it is. People feel emotionally/mentally unwell & off they go to the Doctor to get a diagnosis & some drugs – that’s what everyone has done in this thread – they have played their part in it all.\\nWe live in a deeply sick society – humanity is sick.

People who engage with psychiatry are told they are ill or led to believe they are ill, only to learn later that the problem is not a physical disease but a reaction to other things going on in life- which can include but are not limited to real physical issues such as cancer, etc. Or divorce, bereavement etc.\\nWe were lied to by the medical establishment, and by society which exhorts people to obey white coats without question.\\nReport comment\\nAs far as ‘ill’ and ‘unwell’ are concerned, these are highly relative terms interpreted in so many various ways, which carry a lot of energy, judgment, and stigma on them, Many schools of thought on this. So that’s a dissertation waiting to be written.\\nI agree with the author and the majority on here that we were taught to trust blindly what turned out to be the wrong people, and we were taught to think about ourselves in a way that was negative and inaccurate. Trauma, family dysfunction, etc., create this internal reality for us: we are sick and we need to see a doctor. It’s a cultural program, from family beliefs, media, and social norms–mostly based on terribly limited information and downright deceit and manipulation for the purpose of control. That’s standard procedure among the power elite, to fool the masses.\\nWe are re-writing this now. We are defining ourselves our way, by our truth, which seems to be working well for each of us, as we grow in number, by example, and with credible voices, far and away from this other nonsense, which is how I label this process of diagnosing and medicating. It is non-sense, as in, makes no sense. We have so much proof of this.\\nEven those you are calling ‘unwell’ aren’t helped by this, and there are so many other ways. They need to stop lying and being in denial. That’s what is damaging to society right now.\\nI’m not saying that we’re not talking about some kind of imbalance at times, either within a person or within their life, that needs addressing, that happens to all of us, it’s human. We all have issues and challenges to face, and we do it however is best for ourselves.\\nMany of us thought psychiatry was the way to go because that was the propaganda, that it exists to help resolve issues, heal our mental chaos and confusion, and relieve anxiety; whereas it does exactly the opposite, over and over again. This mental health treatment crap creates problems where they don’t exist, and makes the problems that people had upon seeking help even bigger and more entrenched.\\nAND, they know it, it’s obvious, and they are digging their heals in, can’t surrender to the client’s voice as the last word.\\nThat’s where I would, indeed, blame them for the harm being done here. They don’t want to hear thousands or millions of voices in truth! We’re talking quality of life, family, communities, and life & deaths issues, here.\\nSo yes, I’d point the finger at psychiatry, too, I think that is just and accurate, beyond a doubt. I point the finger to identify the problem in society as precisely as possible, in order to fix this situation–that is, to remove the problem and allow for better solutions to come in, non-institutional, to my mind.\\nRe classes, the upper tiers of society tend to shame and demean others, patronize at best, to preserve their illusion of ‘social rank.’ They make it up, based on arbitrary rules of their society. That’s what snobbery is, which is what comes from class division, people who think they’re ‘better’ for whatever reason, based totally on superficial things, that really don’t matter, but they want people to know they have what others could not possible acquire.\\nAlthough I think this, in reality, is not true, but an illusion that has been created, that some are limited while others are not. Not true, but we can believe it if we’re taught this, until we wake up.\\nI have found this to be the case, in general, with psychiatry, and a huge part of the problem, this kind snobbery, where they project lack and limitation onto clients, and worse yet, they fabricate a chronic illness to get you hooked on drugs for life. There is a definite class issue here, and it affects how ‘sick’ and ‘well’ are perceived and addressed, most definitely. I think it’s pronounced and obvious, goes without saying.\\nIndeed, psychiatry has had its day. It has caused too many problems in the name of solving them. It makes no sense to preserve it at this point.\\nReport comment\\nA very complex question as to the psychopathology, neurology, brain function – physiological/biologic aspects to mental health conditions.\\ni take a holistic/integral view – bio/psycho/social/spiritual – But i wouldn’t deny the biological elements.\\nReport comment\\nI don’t deny the biological aspects to any issue.

At least as adults, this would be the case. It’s why I feel that research and incessant debate about what is or is not illness or wellness and what treatments work for what and how we interpret life’s events can fall short of what is really important–to alleviate our individual suffering. More than anything, that’s what I most appreciate on here, the stories of people who found their way out of suffering. That’s what I most care about.\\nIf what you did helps you in that department, then of course it is right for you! Hardly anything that is discussed here is universal. Why such nasty arguments occur, I don’t know.\\nPerhaps we can learn to respect a bit more our individuality, and not argue about the reality of others. I think that’s a total waste of time and energy which takes us off track considerably, while also being rather hurtful to people, understandably. Healing is hard, courageous work which makes us all feel vulnerable. True, authentic universal respect would be a wonderful healing agent in here, I believe. I’m sorry if you feel this is idealistic.

Of course, i understand that for various reasons there are those people that don’t consider they have any illness to begin with, & maybe they are right?\\ni suppose this is part of the problem with current psychiatry – where diagnosis is largely based on subjective interpretation on what is being presented (speech & behaviour). i think that some kind of distinctions need to made between who is suffering a more severe form of mental illness & who isn’t. That would be difficult to do, but i don’t think impossible.\\nIn the UK there are far stricter controls on who receives a diagnosis of severe mental illness (for example). There would be ways, i think, of filtering out severity of condition. Lumping everyone together under the same ‘mental illness/health’ umbrella, just is not working, & we don’t do that with physical health. There is likely even more variety within mental health – far more distinctions should be made, & people taken on an individual case by case basis. That may stop some of these stories here.\\ni do know how some people ‘present’ to health professionals – with a lot of moaning, crying, wailing & screaming, when it’s obvious it’s their own little ego drama/stage performance, & little in reality is really that wrong. Whose fault is that if people present that way? In what way are health authorities meant to respond? The sad reality is, regardless of what may be wrong with people (or not) the majority want their labels & drugs. Some realise what that actually entails further down the line – i think people should be far more aware of what it all entails to begin with, i was.\\ni’d love to see a paradigm shift & transformation within all these areas – But that does require the masses Wake Up from their self induced collective trance of mass stupidity.\\nReport comment\\nI think I can speak for Szasz when I write the mind can not be diseased. The mind can be wrong or right, legal or criminal but thoughts and emotions are not diseases.” Diseases are malfunctions of the human body, of the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brain”.\\nIf someone is NOT functioning ( eating and sleeping like a Hominid) , it may be considered a mercy to have a psychiatric intervention.

The mind can be wrong or right, legal or criminal but thoughts and emotions are not diseases.” Diseases are malfunctions of the human body, of the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brain”.”\\nIt’s very simplistic reasoning & Szasz has been arguably very well refuted, & i’m not going to repeat all those arguments here, when a little research would suffice. A lot depends on whether ‘you’ take a dualism perspective, but imo of course the mind can be ill, of course there is a potential for psychopathology. Szasz was/is sorely mistaken.\\n‘If someone is NOT functioning ( eating and sleeping like a Hominid) , it may be considered a mercy to have a psychiatric intervention. RE”who is suffering a more severe form of mental illness & who isn’t”‘\\nimo i think it obvious there are cases of far more severe psychological/emotional distress/illness within some people than others.\\nReport comment\\n7 years post my heart failure due to a medically abusive psychiatric staff while in the care of my State’s mental health hospital after having gone well into the onset of renal failure from a “lethal cocktail” prescribed by the administering outpatient care, when they found I was ill responsive to all anti-psychotic medications for a never before present malady of depression that had been initiated from an initial prescription of antidepressants meant to help with an ignored case of stress induced generalized anxiety from overworking. They are at it again. AstraZeneca knows no limits in their malignant behavior to get FDA approval, and no remorse in who they will discredit in the process. 0ver 80% of the inpatient population, regardless of their initial diagnosis were given measure of treatment to ensure that their drug Seroquel XR would be passed for use on PTSD, people who were being treated for alcoholism, depression, you name it were reassessed to have Bipolar NOS or some variation to approve use of Seroquel in varying quantities regardless of past medication success/failure or lacking evidence to prove diagnosis. I do not care where you live or who you are to say otherwise: this is unconscionable, and bordering if not directly equivalent to eugenics type practices, where the medical practitioner and institution is monetarily motivated to pass falsified judgement, using below fuzzy logic to justify income supplementation. Promising Trial of Drug for Mental Illness Unravels http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/business/seroquel-xr-drug-trial-frayed-promise.html?_r=0 I hope posting this article is acceptable information.. Thank You Amy Upham for taking your story serious enough to publish and pass along your lessons! looking forward to reading your book.\\nReport comment\\nMost of what was written in my previous comment above is not part of the article because it was my personal experience in an otherwise relative situation that unfortunately continues by the same megalith Co. that strikes a massively abusive discord for mental wellness in their practices. I believe that it supplements Amy Upham’s own experiences of medical negligence. I empathize greatly for anyone who has had to face these uncertainties and abysmal forms of malpractice with no ability of seeking reformative and rehabilitating justice to compensate their losses. Sometimes all we have is our voice and the accumulative expressions of our experience to afford us the weight of the damages undertaken at the hands of such seemingly untouchable forces.\\nReport comment\\n“I do not care where you live or who you are to say otherwise: this is unconscionable, and bordering if not directly equivalent to eugenics type practices, where the medical practitioner and institution is monetarily motivated to pass falsified judgement, using below fuzzy logic to justify income supplementation.”\\nYes, yes, yes. Abuse, systemic abuse and genocide are the only words for polypharmacy practices and psychiatric abuses such as seclusion and restraint, which kill 2 people each week in hospitals. What other words when folks treated in the public mental health system die 25 years earlier than everyone else? Unconscionable, unethical, immoral, medical malpractice and all the rest. The FDA as accomplice.\\nI hope you have recovered from the heart and renal failure. It is only by miracle and my growing up in a medical household that I was able to treat myself and recover.\\nAll the best and in solidarity,\\nAmy\\nReport comment\\nMadOmOLandly – Right. They assume you have forever to adjust to whatever you suffer, and can’t bother to learn what it is. It is what the label says, and so you must somehow really feel glad to know them in the mental hosptial. That’s what I ran into and sound like what you endured, too. So now the “right” labels also make no sense to use, because the clinicians’ s knowing more than me is magnitudes less likely at this point. They were so pointless in their attentions to me, even the nicest ones, except for proving that they could have been helpful if they weren’t brainwashed about the whole approach to care. What mattered most was that with one particular hospitalization, many staff began to tell me they didn’t understand why I was being kept so long. Specifically different ones each began to act more strangely and accusatorily toward me, as though I were hiding something by acting so typically like we were equals in the game. The only ideal treatment that ever came my way happened to come from a lawyer who won the early release for me in the mental health court. Probably somehow another doctor who noticed that my case was much less exageratedly abnormal than my doctor pretended about me must have influenced the situation. Between my lawyer and whoever or whatever else rescued me, that was up there with the best psychological treatment for me since getting labelled. (Court happened without me, there, but the result was as good to wait on as to have in person, too.)\\nReport comment\\nAmy – Congratulations yourself for all you got through and have started heading towards. Your responses were also very generous to all concerned. I doubt that anyone could actually complain that they felt left out or ignored, notwithstanding the reliable commenters in the thread. You have great perspicacity and incredible focus on communicating with respect to the central issue in what someone says to you.\\nReport comment\\nFirst, I believe that the term “worried well” I think coined by E Fuller Torrey is without conscience. It is is a derogatory term used to hurt people who are already suffering for whatever reason. There is no such person as “worried well.” Thank you, Amy for being brave and bringing your story out that so many of us must overcome.\\nSecond, I will bring some “familial” input into this psychiatric/bigpharma bullying, bigotry and control. To me, my mother signifies in a smaller way this psychiatric/bigpharma terror we have all undergone. She is “unhappy” with me because I did something healthy and strong for me! I drove my new car into the mountains for a little trip. She considers that selfish and irresponsibile. Everything worked out so great! This is the first time I have been able to drive since being under the influence of the harmful meds. My dear mother is so worried and obsessed with money and control that she denies me my right to do what I know is good for me! This is in a small way the way the psychiatrists treat us. They give us dangerous, deadly meds and are very afraid that we will find out and rebel against their alleged authority and control! Thank you again, Amy for all your comments. You are a very smart, courageous and inspirational person! Keep up your greatness!\\nReport comment\\nLEAVE A REPLY'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Review: The Dygma Split Keyboard is an Ergonomic Style Icon | The New York Sun Dygma Makes Ergonomics a Style Statement\\nDygma’s hyper configurable, ergonomic keyboards show that comfort doesn’t need to be ugly\\nCourtesy of Dygma\\nDygma Raise Keyboard. Courtesy of Dygma\\nThe ergonomic keyboard market is not filled with elegant design. The most popular items are the lumpy, slightly warped looking plastic boards from Microsoft, which aren’t much more comfortable than a classic keyboard, but are a lot uglier. On the other end of spectrum, you have Apple’s design studio fodder, the “Magic” keyboard, trackpad, and mouse, which are chic but painful to use over the the long-term. The great designers at Cupertino didn’t want to compromise their aesthetic vision for the limits of the human hand.\\nBut what if ergonomics was the core to a keyboard design, pushing the look to the absolute extreme, but to the benefit of wrist health? This is the vision behind Dygma’s split keyboards, the Raise and Defy, and having used a review sample of the Raise for a month, they are the most unique, high-quality keyboards I’ve ever tried, but are also certainly not without their challenges.\\nAn ergonomic keyboard lifts and rotates the angle of your hands off the table, positioning your wrists closer to a relaxed handshake grip, and away from the flat, “pronated” twist that is required for typing on traditional keyboards. For the Raise — and its successor, the Raise 2, currently up for pre-order — Dygma improves on this by doing three things.\\nFirst, it’s a split keyboard, meaning your hands can be spaced further apart, at about shoulder width; and secondly, related to that, they can be rotated slightly inward, to match where your hands naturally fall. Finally, its “Raise” name comes from being able to “tent” the keyboard at various angles, from completely flat to a steep 60 degrees, where you type sideways, against the keyboard.\\xa0\\nIt’s very unique, and the first hour using it is a rollercoaster ride; first being impressed by the cold metal construction, beautiful felt-lined travel case, handy accessories, and great look, but then running straight into the steep learning curve that comes with actually typing on the keyboard.\\nIn order to arrange the keyboard in such a way that it can be split and rotated, the shortcut keys aren’t quite in their usual spaces, but moved to the centre, controlled by your thumbs. These can be remapped, but the layout is fundamentally untraditional, and it’s still a hard change, particularly for users who’ve built muscle memory for complex shortcuts.\\nThe purpose of an ergonomic keyboard is that your hands should be comfortable, natural, and shouldn’t need to leave the keyboard surface often; but for over a week, it was a chore to do even basic shortcuts, like going to the start of a line, or selecting four words and cutting them.\\nThis did get better over time, but for the first weeks, even basic shortcuts would result in my accidentally turning the RGB lights of the keyboard off, or deleting a line, sending me rushing for Ctrl + Z, which I struggled to find.\\xa0\\nEven if you don’t regularly use shortcuts, a keyboard like this is still hard to use, as it is also built assuming you comply with perfect touch-typing rules. If you don’t, and for example, type “B” with a different hand depending on the word flow, then adjusting can be a struggle, and there are an endless number of small invisible typing habits that turn into hurdles on a split, raised board\\nWith patience though, you can really get the flow of this board, and after a few weeks, I was starting to get close to my normal speed, and able to fall into flow states whilst using it. You also don’t need to go split, twisted, and raised all at once; the keyboard can be used together as a classic flat keyboard, and gradually tweaked; and there is no keyboard that can be adjusted as comprehensively as the Raise.\\nMy only real quibble is — as it so often is for nice things from small companies — the price. The Raise 2 starts at\\xa0$369, with a pre-order saving that brings it down by about $70; but this is for a wired version, without tenting, and without lighting; elements that I would view as essential for buying this keyboard.\\nA version including all three will run you $619; and even with a pre-order savings of $110, that’s still $509.\\nIt’s an expensive keyboard; but there’s nothing quite like it, and I know tech reporters who bought the first generation some years ago, still use it every day, and wouldn’t think of switching boards.\\nThe New York Sun\\n© 2025 The New York Sun Company, LLC.

Among the factors that lead to the occurrence of gastrointestinal infections are the hygienic and sanitary deficiencies that characterize our markets and other places where raw or cooked food is sold, poor environmental sanitation in communities, deficiencies in water treatment (or in the process of its plumbing), risky hygienic-sanitary habits (not washing hands after major and/or minor needs), among others. These are generally consequences (signs and symptoms) resulting from gastrointestinal infections: diarrhea, vomiting, fever and malaise, among others. The treatment consists of replacing lost liquids and electrolytes (drinking drinking water and other recommended liquids, including consumption of juicy fruits such as papayas, apples, pears, among others that contain water in their composition). To prevent this, it is necessary to promote health education, improve the hygienic-sanitary conditions of markets and communities in general as a way of promoting, preserving and prolonging PUBLIC HEALTH. 1 Biologist, Master\\'s student in Public Health, University Professor, Public Health Mentor and Student Assistant. Public Health Lessons. Xai-Xai, Mozambique, June 2024 Email: osvaldomuchanga.om@gmail.com\\nGastritis and Gastric Health Gastric Health is one of the most relevant concerns in human health, with gastrointestinal infections being among the main illnesses that affect humans. Among gastric problems, we have GASTRITIS AND GASTRIC ULCERS as the main public health problems. Gastritis and gastric ulcers normally result from inflammation and corrosion of the walls of the stomach (gastric mucosa) and are generally associated (caused) by the bacterium Helicobacter pylor, which, according to the literature, this bacterium settles on these walls (of the stomach) and starts to release urease that ends up altering the normal pH of the stomach (acid), which leads to inflammation and corrosion of the mucous membranes and consequent gastritis or ulcers, respectively. In addition to bacterial infections, gastritis and gastric ulcers are associated with several factors, with emphasis on prolonged fasting, chemical substances including drugs, alcohol, foods with strong seasonings including chilli, which ends up causing inflammation of the stomach walls and/or corrosion. of the same, resulting in the appearance of wounds and consequent gastritis or ulcers, respectively. Among patients with gastritis and/or ulcers, one of the dilemmas is associated with the foods to consume in order to minimize the sensation of pain and discomfort. From this perspective, foods that are easy to digest and that do not leave substrates or \"cones\" after grinding (chewing) are recommended, thus preventing them from settling on the walls of the stomach, causing the usual pain and thus PROMOTING, PRESERVING AND PROLONGING PUBLIC HEALTH .

GASTROINTESTINAL INFECTIONS AND GASTRITIS Osvaldo Bernardo Muchanga 1 Gastrointestinal Infections GASTROINTESTINAL INFECTIONS result from the ingestion of pathogens that cause infections at the level of this tract, generally being transmitted by food, water and hands contaminated by microorganisms such as E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus, Rotavirus among others that are generally contained in feces, thus configuring a FECAL-ORAL type of transmission. Among the factors that lead to the occurrence of gastrointestinal infections are the hygienic and sanitary deficiencies that characterize our markets and other places where raw or cooked food is sold, poor environmental sanitation in communities, deficiencies in water treatment (or in the process of its plumbing), risky hygienic-sanitary habits (not washing hands after major and/or minor needs), among others. These are generally consequences (signs and symptoms) resulting from gastrointestinal infections: diarrhea, vomiting, fever and malaise, among others. The treatment consists of replacing lost liquids and electrolytes (drinking drinking water and other recommended liquids, including consumption of juicy fruits such as papayas, apples, pears, among others that contain water in their composition). To prevent this, it is necessary to promote health education, improve the hygienic-sanitary conditions of markets and communities in general as a way of promoting, preserving and prolonging PUBLIC HEALTH. 1 Biologist, Master\\'s student in Public Health, University Professor, Public Health Mentor and Student Assistant.

Gastritis and Gastric Health Gastric Health is one of the most relevant concerns in human health, with gastrointestinal infections being among the main illnesses that affect humans. Among gastric problems, we have GASTRITIS AND GASTRIC ULCERS as the main public health problems. Gastritis and gastric ulcers normally result from inflammation and corrosion of the walls of the stomach (gastric mucosa) and are generally associated (caused) by the bacterium Helicobacter pylor, which, according to the literature, this bacterium settles on these walls (of the stomach) and starts to release urease that ends up altering the normal pH of the stomach (acid), which leads to inflammation and corrosion of the mucous membranes and consequent gastritis or ulcers, respectively. In addition to bacterial infections, gastritis and gastric ulcers are associated with several factors, with emphasis on prolonged fasting, chemical substances including drugs, alcohol, foods with strong seasonings including chilli, which ends up causing inflammation of the stomach walls and/or corrosion. of the same, resulting in the appearance of wounds and consequent gastritis or ulcers, respectively. Among patients with gastritis and/or ulcers, one of the dilemmas is associated with the foods to consume in order to minimize the sensation of pain and discomfort. From this perspective, foods that are easy to digest and that do not leave substrates or \"cones\" after grinding (chewing) are recommended, thus preventing them from settling on the walls of the stomach, causing the usual pain and thus PROMOTING, PRESERVING AND PROLONGING PUBLIC HEALTH .

Μετά τον καταιγισμό των πληροφοριών και των καταγγελιών που είδαν το φως της δημοσιότητας, αποφασίσαμε να μη μείνουμε αδρανείς και να μη δεχθούμε αυτές τις πράξεις ως τη νέα πραγματικότητα» αναφέρει στη Voria.gr ο 30χρονος Γιάννης Κεσίδης, ιδρυτής της Palmeria Clothing. «Δεν το ξέχασαν ποτέ, απλά τώρα είναι κατάλληλες οι συνθήκες, τώρα βρίσκουν ευήκοα ώτα» σχολιάζει εμφατικά.\\nΤα μηνύματα που είναι τυπωμένα στη μέση του μπροστινού μέρους των ρούχων, συνοδεύει το χάσταγκ #metoogr καθώς και μία λιβελούλα, τοποθετημένη στο ύψος της καρδιάς. Όπως λέει ο Γιάννης Κεσίδης, πρόκειται για έντομο που συμβολίζει την αλλαγή, την οποία «πρέπει να φέρουμε χωρίς να δεχόμαστε ως δικαιολογίες τα στερεότυπα, χωρίς να ανεχόμαστε τέτοια περιστατικά και παρόμοιες πεποιθήσεις».\\nΤα μπλουζάκια έχουν αρχίσει ήδη να διατίθενται στη συμβολική τιμή των 15,90€, που παραπέμπει στη γραμμή SOS 15900, αριθμό στον οποίο απευθύνονται γυναίκες θύµατα βίας ή τρίτα πρόσωπα που θέλουν να επικοινωνήσουν άµεσα µε ένα φορέα αντιµετώπισης της έµφυλης βίας. Όλα τα έσοδα από την αγορά των T-Shirt θα διατεθούν στη ΜΚΟ W.I.N. Hellas.\\nΤα μπλουζάκια είναι διαθέσιμα στην ιστοσελίδα της Palmeria Clothing, στην ενότητα charity, και προς το παρόν βγαίνουν σε άσπρο χρώμα. Εάν υπάρξει ζήτηση, η εταιρεία θα τυπώσει ρούχα και σε άλλα χρώματα. Το τύπωμα των T-Shirt έχει αναλάβει το κατάστημα Fruit of the Loom.\\nΟ Γιάννης Κεσίδης\\xa0\\nΑξίζει να σημειωθεί πως η Palmeria Clothing, που γεννήθηκε το καλοκαίρι του 2020, στη μέση της πανδημικής κρίσης, έχει θέσει στο επίκεντρο των βασικών της στόχων όχι μόνο τη βιωσιμότητα της επιχείρησης, αλλά και την προώθηση της κοινωνικής της ταυτότητας.\\nΣτο πλαίσιο αυτό, στην ιστοσελίδα της επιχείρησης έχουν ήδη αναρτηθεί ενημερωτικά κείμενα που αφορούν στον καρκίνο του μαστού, στην ημέρα του παιδικού καρκίνου και φυσικά στην καταπολέμηση της βίας κατά των γυναικών, ενώ η ενότητα ανανεώνεται ανά τακτά διαστήματα. «Το κοινωνικό μας προφίλ έχει κεντρικό ρόλο στην εταιρεία μας. Πάνω από όλα είμαστε άνθρωποι και τα κοινωνικά ζητήματα μάς αφορούν όλους ανεξαιρέτως» καταλήγει ο Γιάννης Κεσίδης.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Common Stomach & Gastrointestinal (GI) Issues | TYLENOL® Skip to main content\\n9 Common Stomach and Gastrointestinal Issues\\nwoman hunched over holding stomach in pain as she gets up out of bed\\nYou’ve likely heard the term before, but you may be wondering, “What is GI and what does it stand for?” The gastrointestinal (GI) tract or system refers to the organs that form a long tube, leading from the mouth to the anus. This system helps digest and move food and drink through your body to get the nutrients it needs. The GI tract is made up of your:1\\nMouth\\nEsophagus\\nStomach\\nSmall intestine\\nLarge intestine (colon, rectum, and anus)\\nSometimes, GI issues can develop that affect how well the GI tract works. These can also lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation.2 Knowing the different types of GI diseases and their symptoms can help you get the appropriate care if needed.\\nTypes of GI Diseases\\nThere are two main types of GI disorders:\\nFunctional\\nStructural\\nThese can affect any part of the GI tract, causing different conditions and diseases.\\nFunctional Gastrointestinal Disorders\\nFunctional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are disorders that don’t appear to have a physical cause that can be diagnosed with standard testing methods like blood tests, x-rays, or other imaging tests. Instead, FGIDs are thought to be caused by a combination of abnormal muscle contractions, sensitive nerves, and brain-gut dysfunction, which affects communications between the brain and GI tract:3,4 Examples of these disorders include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).5\\nStructural Gastrointestinal Disorders\\nOn the other hand, structural gastrointestinal disorders (SGIDs) are caused by physical changes to the GI tract, leading to symptoms. These disorders can be detected with imaging tests and/or bloodwork. Examples of SGIDs include tumors, strictures (narrowing of the tract), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).5\\n9 Common Stomach Conditions\\nBelow is a list of 9 common stomach conditions and their signs and symptoms.\\n1. Diverticulitis\\nDiverticulitis involves inflammation of small sacs or pouches (known as diverticula) in the lower colon that push outwards in weak spots. Symptoms of this condition include pain and cramping in the lower left abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and fever.6\\n2. Crohn’s Disease (CD)\\nCD is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and irritation mainly in the small and large intestines. Common symptoms of CD include abdominal pain and cramping, weight loss, and diarrhea.7,8\\n3. Ulcerative Colitis (UC)\\nUC is another chronic inflammatory disease, but it mainly affects the large intestine (colon). Symptoms of UC include abdominal pain and cramping, bloody stools, diarrhea, and constantly feeling the urge to have a bowel movement even if your bowel is empty.9,10\\n4. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)\\nIBS refers to a group of GI symptoms that occur together that cause abdominal pain and affect your bowel movements. Depending on the type of IBS you have, you may experience painful bowel movements with diarrhea, constipation, or both.11,12\\n5. GERD (Heartburn & Acid Reflux)\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to severe, chronic acid reflux caused by stomach acid coming back up your esophagus. Symptoms of GERD include stomach pain, heartburn, chest pain, nausea, and regurgitation (food coming back up your esophagus and into your throat or mouth).13,14\\n6. Stomach Ulcer (Peptic Ulcer)\\nStomach ulcers are sores that form in the lining of your stomach or first part of your small intestine (duodenum). Symptoms of these ulcers include nausea, vomiting, bloating, severe stomach pain, and feeling full early in a meal or after eating.15,16\\n7. Ulcer (General)\\nUlcers can also form in other parts of the GI tract, including the esophagus. Symptoms of esophageal ulcers include chest pain, nausea, vomiting, pain when swallowing, and feeling like food is stuck in your throat. 17\\n8. Stomach Bleeding\\nStomach bleeding is a symptom of many GI tract diseases. Symptoms can include bright red bloody vomit, abdominal cramps, vomit that looks similar to coffee grounds, black or tar-like stools, bright red or dark blood in stools, and shortness of breath.18\\n9. Gastritis\\nGastritis refers to inflammation in the stomach lining. Symptoms of gastritis include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Breakdown of the stomach lining or ulcers may also cause stomach bleeding.19,20\\nAcetaminophen & Stomach Problems\\nAcetaminophen, the active ingredient in TYLENOL®, is an effective pain reliever and is safe when used as directed. It can be a good pain relief option for those with stomach problems.21\\nWhy TYLENOL® May Be a Better Choice\\nFor those with a history of stomach problems, TYLENOL® can be a more appropriate pain relief option than NSAIDs like ALEVE®, Advil®, or MOTRIN® (Third party trademarks are the property of their respective owners). It’s the #1 doctor recommended pain reliever brand for people with stomach problems because it is safe, gentle, and doesn’t irritate the stomach like the way ALEVE® or even Advil® or MOTRIN® can.\\nYou can learn more about why TYLENOL® can be a good pain relief choice for those with stomach issues by clicking here.\\nWhen To Talk to Your Doctor\\nTalk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns about your symptoms or about whether TYLENOL® is right for you. TYLENOL® provides strong pain relief and is gentle on the stomach.\\nThird party trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\\nReferences\\nFikree A, Byrne P.

       "  'text': \"'The #MeToo movement needs to stay angry, if we are to deliver real change for women' | Marie Claire UK 'The #MeToo movement needs to stay angry, if we are to deliver real change for women'\\nAs the accused sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein's trial gathers pace, Shivonne Graham, Managing Director of Women for Women International, says his Hollywood ending is not enough for the global #MeToo movement\\n#MeToo movement\\nAs the accused sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein's trial gathers pace, Shivonne Graham, Managing Director of Women for Women International, says his Hollywood ending is not enough for the global #MeToo movement\\n'We women have historically been trained to be pleasant at all times. We need to stop that and be authentic; justifiable anger is a part of that. Being angry is OK.' These are the words of Rose McGowan, taken from her painfully honest memoir, Brave. I was listening to Rose narrate the audiobook while I was driving. As one of the first whistle-blowers of the #MeToo movement, hearing the actress recount what she has gone through is heart-breaking.\\nHarvey Weinstein is now facing trial in New York for rape and sexual assault, and it feels like the final act of an Oscar-worthy legal drama. Hollywood has conditioned me to want a fairytale ending for Rose and her fellow survivors. But during my seven years at Women for Women International, I have seen how the law so rarely delivers justice for survivors of rape and sexual violence, and how it more typically ignores, excludes or harms them.\\nWhile there will be a symbolic power to watching Weinstein sitting in the dock, this trial won’t deliver the systemic change we desperately need. Certainly not for those women and girls who are most vulnerable to violence and abuse – those living in poverty, those caught up in conflict, those at the margins of society.\\nNevertheless, I do think there are some vitally important lessons we can learn from the Weinstein case – lessons that should galvanise us as we enter the next act of the #MeToo movement. Because this story is far from over.\\n1. Storytelling is powerful\\nWhile I had read many reports on the Weinstein scandal, listening to McGowan tell her own story affected me on a different level. She described how throughout her life she had been controlled and silenced by powerful men – during her childhood in a cult, trapped in an abusive relationship, and then as a young actress in Hollywood. Now, she has emphatically reclaimed control of her own narrative.\\nHearing Rose’s story makes me think of the many other stories that remain untold. Poverty, conflict and trauma greatly increase women and girls’ vulnerability to abuse – our programme is filled with women who have experienced this first-hand. Some have endured rape at the hands of soldiers or militia, who use sexual violence as a weapon of war. Many more women living in conflict zones or as refugees will be subjected to abuse at the hands of their partners or family members; war and displacement have been shown to fuel rates of domestic violence and forced marriage.\\nWhile some women I have met wanted to share their stories – which will stay with me forever – the vast majority do not disclose their ordeals because of the stigma and discrimination associated with sexual violence. Women who have been raped during conflict are frequently rejected by their husbands and ostracised by their communities. They are taught to stay silent, to internalise the pain and turn their anger on themselves.\\n#MeToo has brought women’s unfiltered pain and anger out into the open. Some women will encounter greater obstacles to speaking up than others. We need to ensure all women can feel the power of taking control of their own story.\\n#MeToo movement\\nHarvey Weinstein arrives in court in New York (courtesy of Getty Images)\\n2. Laws are not enough\\nIn order to speak out, women need to know that they will be listened to and believed. But police stations, lawyers’ offices and courtrooms are rarely safe, impartial spaces for women to tell their stories. All around the world, our legal systems are failing to punish abusers and shield women and girls from violence.\\nThe Weinstein case is being tried in a comparatively peaceful, prosperous society, where the rule of law is taken for granted. However, a woman in rural northern Nigeria, for example, faces immeasurably greater barriers to seeing her rapist prosecuted, if she takes that first daunting step of coming forward.\\nAs in many conflict-affected countries, national and international laws enshrining gender equality and protecting women’s rights are not effectively enforced. A much stronger, unwritten code of customary law treats women as the property of men. 23% of Nigerian women have experienced physical or sexual violence committed by a husband. But, to quote one of my Nigerian colleagues: 'If a woman goes to the police and tells them her husband raped her, they will say, ‘what do you mean?’ According to the law, a husband cannot rape his wife.'\\nA photo posted by on\\n3. Social change is vital\\xa0\\nMajor cultural transformation is a complex, gradual process, as generations of women’s rights activists will testify. It is not glamorous; it doesn’t fit the neat story arc of a Hollywood movie. But it is deeply, urgently necessary.\\nA powerful man facing a jury and being held accountable for his actions sends a decisive message, not just to survivors, but to society at large, about how we should treat sexual violence.\\nIn a similar way, the landmark cases establishing the prosecution of rape as a war crime, a crime against humanity and genocide under international law, have been deeply significant – despite the very small number of convictions. They strike an important blow against a culture of impunity, rooted in gender inequalities and power imbalances, where violence against women is normalised.\\nBut we don’t just absorb lessons about gender and power from our legal institutions. We learn them at home, at school, in the workplace, walking down the street. Cultural change is needed, at every level, to tackle the roots of sexual violence – the harmful gender norms that are part of our social fabric.\\nWhatever the legal outcome in the Weinstein trial, we must not lose sight of this much bigger picture. The #MeToo movement has unleashed an explosive and devastating collective testimony of women’s pain. Now, we need to look beyond our desire for a familiar, feel-good Hollywood ending, and concentrate on the mammoth task at hand.

       "  'text': 'Alec Baldwin On Trump, Hollywood and Why Everyone is Out To Get Him Skip to main content\\nGot a tip?\\nNewsletters\\nThe Complicated Politics of Alec Baldwin\\nIn his cover story for The Hollywood Reporter, Alec Baldwin talks about his return to television with \\'The Alec Baldwin Show,\\' impersonating Trump and why everyone\\'s \"out to get him\" amid the #MeToo era.\\n“I don’t want to get this wrong …”\\xa0\\nAlec Baldwin begins many of his sentences this way, signaling that he’s about to dive into trouble.\\nThe first time comes as he’s wolfing down a slice from Famous Original Ray’s — a Ninth Avenue hole-in-the-wall that’s neither famous nor original, “but at this point,” he says, “Grandpa’s hungry.” The conversation has turned, at Baldwin’s urging, to the #MeToo movement and the growing list of men whose careers have imploded amid allegations of sexual misconduct.\\n“I want to preface this by saying that all these guys who have done terrible things, who doesn’t want them punished? This whole idea that I’m covering for [accused director] Jimmy Toback or whatever? The minute that people are found guilty of some crime or there’s a glistening reservoir of information or evidence …”\\nRelated Stories\\nHe pauses there, takes a swig of cream soda and dives in.\\n“It’s not a witch hunt because a witch hunt indicates that there is very little truth, if none at all, and there is a lot of truth here. But what worries me is that this is a fire that needs constant kindling.” Late last fall, it all became personal. In the wake of Harvey Weinstein’s unraveling, a publication reached out to one of Baldwin’s former co-stars and began questioning her about his behavior on a particular 1980s film set. The actress, who’d been a minor at the time, contacted Baldwin to let him know. (In sharing the story for the first time, he asked that I omit the names.)\\n“She goes, ‘Alec, they called me and they said that a wardrobe person said you sexually molested me and that you constantly had me sitting on your lap and they asked me for a comment.’ I go, ‘My God, what did you say?’ And she said, ‘I told them it was ridiculous, that you never groped me.\\'” I can feel Baldwin’s blood pressure rising from across the table. “I just remember thinking in that moment, ‘Wow, they’re looking for people. This is a fire that needs fresh wood, and they’re coming for me.\\'”\\nNo story ever materialized, and though Baldwin has taken hits for defending pals like Toback and Woody Allen, his own career has not been damaged. In fact, at 60, he can’t remember ever being this busy. In the past year or two, he’s popped up in at least a dozen movies and TV shows, including the latest installment of Mission: Impossible, Hulu’s The Looming Tower and awards contender A Star Is Born; emceed an acclaimed podcast (WNYC’s Here’s the Thing) and a popular game show (ABC’s Match Game); won an Emmy for his Donald Trump impression on Saturday Night Live; authored two books (his own memoir and a mock presidential one); lent his voice to the New York Philharmonic; and raised a few million dollars for a collection of arts causes close to his heart. And now, he’s about to take what could be his biggest gamble yet: The Alec Baldwin Show, airing at 10 p.m. Sundays on ABC starting Oct. 14.\\nFor those keeping track, it’ll be Baldwin’s second shot at carrying his own talk show. In 2013, MSNBC created a late-night vehicle for him that’s remembered mostly for how quickly it got canceled — five episodes in, after he allegedly hurled a homophobic slur at a photographer during a confrontation outside his apartment. (He’s long denied the language but apologized nonetheless.) ABC is betting that over the past five years, the oldest and most successful of the four Baldwin brothers has wised up. “If there’s a risk, it’s a fairly mild one,” ABC’s alternative programming chief Rob Mills tells me, though it’s hard to imagine a less forgiving media environment for an aging white guy with a penchant for running his mouth. His wife, Hilaria, has urged Baldwin not to Google himself, but he admits he can’t always heed her advice.\\n“So, you read these things where people have you in the Ryan O’Neal school of, like, ‘I’m gonna deck a few photographers’ and ‘Don’t you touch my woman’ — and if you’re this two-fisted, Irish, pugilistic kind of person, they have you pegged that way,” he says. “I get it a lot online. People will write, ‘You seem like the kind of guy who would do that.’ Or, ‘You’re next, aren’t you?’ And it’s painful. I mean, what’s worse in this life than being misunderstood?”\\n***\\nOutside, on the streets of Manhattan,\\xa0it sure doesn’t feel like everyone’s out to get Alec Baldwin.\\nAs we leave Ray’s on an overcast mid-September afternoon, a young man hollers, “Duuuude, you do that Donald Trump thing real good. Real good.” The man introduces himself as Tyrone, and though he’s waving and pointing and causing something of a scene, the often-irritable Baldwin doesn’t mind a bit. In fact, he calls Tyrone over and the two begin cracking each other up. It’s hard to tell who’s enjoying the other more.\\nEver since he unveiled his take on Trump ahead of the 2016 election, Baldwin gets this kind of response “incessantly,” he says. It’s more than just people’s excitement at encountering a celebrity — like Tyrone, they want to express genuine gratitude. “And it’s wild because it’s just this dopey thing I do that took off,” he says, as he momentarily morphs into character: left eye up, right eye down, lips puckered out as far forward as his neck will allow.\\nThen, just as fast, he’s back to himself.\\n“I mean, it’s cartoonish. All I wanted my Trump to be is mean-spirited and miserable, like Mr. Potter from It’s a Wonderful Life. But then I’ll say, ‘Oh, I don’t want to do it anymore,’ and people will go, ‘Don’t you dare give that up, we need you.’ Like I’ve gotten people through something in our nation’s history.”\\nWhen he told me earlier this year that the gag had become “agony” — less the exercise itself than his weekly commitment to it — Trump famously fired back. “Alec,” the president tweeted, “it was agony for those who were forced to watch.” Still, Baldwin plans to return “for some,” he says, “not a lot” of season 44. Out-of-town commitments kept him from appearing on the first two episodes, but he’s expected to be back for the Oct. 13 show. “I’m going to mosey in there and hopefully we’ll have a fresh round of indictments to tear into,” he says, smiling, as he adds: “From my mouth to Robert Mueller’s ears.”\\nFor a time, Baldwin had been toying with taking his Trump to Broadway, too — turning You Can’t Spell America Without Me, the best-selling parody he co-authored with Kurt Andersen, into a one-man show, the way Will Ferrell once had with his impersonation of George W. Bush. But the Trump news cycle moves too quickly. “I joke with Kurt that getting an available Broadway house is the problem,” he says. “By the time Kinky Boots gets out of there, Trump will be gone.” Instead, Baldwin’s flirting with other ideas for one-man shows, including one centered on Richard Helms, the head of the CIA during the Vietnam War, for which he thinks he has an enthusiastic financial backer lined up.\\nAs we load into the back seat of his SUV, Baldwin’s still buzzing from his exchange with Tyrone. “I don’t know how to say this and I don’t want to get it wrong either, because everything is a minefield of bombs going off, but” — and here it comes — “ever since I played Trump, black people love me. They love me. Everywhere I go, black people go crazy. I think it’s because they’re most afraid of Trump. I’m not going to paint every African-American person with the same brush, but a significant number of them are sitting there going, ‘This is going to be bad for black folks.\\'”\\nBaldwin, as his 1.1 million Twitter followers know, believes that Trump has been bad for everyone. And rather than just slap on a wig and send the guy up every Saturday night, he’s felt compelled to do more. So, heading into the congressional midterms, he’ll be backing a number of Democratic challengers, including Perry Gershon, who’s running in the eastern Long Island district that covers the Hamptons, where the Baldwins keep a second home; and Liuba Grechen Shirley, who’s gunning for GOP heavyweight Peter King’s seat in the part of Long Island where Baldwin grew up. “Peter King’s somebody I’m just dreaming of taking down because he exemplifies everything I detest about Congress,” he says. “These people are completely devoid of any imagination — anything you equate with leadership, they don’t have it.” He’d love to campaign for Antonio Delgado, too, a Rhodes scholar and onetime rap artist who’s running for office a little farther upstate.\\n“Did we ever hear back from the Delgado people?” he asks his wide-eyed assistant, Matt.\\n“We’re waiting to hear back.”\\n“Well, we need to call them,” says Baldwin, perpetually at a low boil. “Today.”\\n***\\nIf there’s one thing that people in the business will tell you about Alec Baldwin — other than sharing their obligatory respect for his acting chops and the intensity he brings to everything he does — it’s that he can be almost impossible to pin down.\\nJust two days after news broke in late August that he’d be joining Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker movie as Bruce Wayne’s father, Baldwin abruptly pulled out, citing conflicts in his schedule. Not long before that, he’d bailed on a much-ballyhooed Kenya Barris comedy, too — one that had been written expressly for him and ordered straight-to-series at ABC. Baldwin says he had some notes on the script that nobody seemed interested in addressing. Barris is just relieved it went away. “Alec’s tough,” he says. “He’s one of the greatest living actors working today, but he’s a taskmaster and I don’t think I could have done that show without him being completely on board and not blown my brains out.” Even Lorne Michaels didn’t know Baldwin would be returning to Saturday Night Live until a few weeks before the current season began.\\nAnd yet, he continues to get projects thrown at him. Come January, Baldwin tells me he’d like to try another TV comedy. He knows he’ll never have it as good as he did on 30 Rock, which gave him a second career — to say nothing of two Emmys and a seemingly bottomless well of goodwill from a certain corner of Hollywood. “Though after seven years, I found myself behaving like the guy,” he says of his character, the blustery, egomaniacal network executive Jack Donaghy. “I’d be at a restaurant and I’d say, ‘Excuse me, in your opinion, is this glass really clean?\\'” Baldwin is cagey with details but says that he’s waiting on three scripts — two multicamera comedies, and a third that would reunite him with Tina Fey — and then he’ll decide which he’ll do. If he does any of them at all.\\nWhat’s clear is that Baldwin either likes to change his mind a lot — or he simply can’t stop himself from doing so. More than once, he has doled out his “last interview,” most famously on a 2014 New York magazine cover that declared his “goodbye to public life.” In the accompanying article, which carried Baldwin’s byline, he announced he had to move out of Manhattan, his home of several decades. Four years later, he, Hilaria and their four young children live in a Greenwich Village penthouse and almost no part of his life, then or now, is private. Of course, after the ugly demise of his first marriage to actress Kim Basinger, which included an even uglier custody battle over their daughter, Ireland, he swore to friends that he was done looking for love, too. Then he met Hilaria, a yoga instructor almost half his age, and, “voila,” he says. He was married a year and a half later.\\n“Alec’s a dreamer,” says his wife, who used to panic every time Baldwin would announce a new plan. “He’d always say to me, ‘I found this really great house in whatever random place,’ and then he’d say, ‘We should move there.’ And I used to actually think we were going to move there, and I’d be like, ‘No, no, no, I can’t live there! I don’t want to move!’ Then I’d realize it was just Alec, daydreaming.”\\nHis memoir, which Hilaria has yet to read (“I live it,” she teases), opens with Baldwin daydreaming about the other lives he wants to lead. He’d love to be the proprietor of a stationery store, he writes, because he’s “obsessed with fine writing paper.” Or to teach, like his late father, or own a gallery or maybe an antique clock shop. In magazine profiles, he used to muse about running for public office one day — mayor, governor, it was hard to keep track. In June, he told Howard Stern that if he ran against Trump in 2020, he’d surely win. By July, he’d ponied up $16,000 in support of another celebrity candidate, Cynthia Nixon, who lost New York’s Democratic gubernatorial primary to incumbent Andrew Cuomo. “I did it to float her name out there for the next thing,” he tells me. “I want her to run for mayor after [Bill] de Blasio terms out.” But in all this time, Baldwin has never once mounted a formal campaign for himself, and when I press him, he acknowledges that his political ambitions are probably — probably — behind him. Why? “Because,” he says, “my wife would divorce me.”\\nBaldwin seizes every opportunity to declare Hilaria “the most amazing woman I’ve ever known”; same for the four children that they’ve spawned in almost as many years. “I know,” he jokes, “why don’t [we] use birth control?” Still, he’s desperate to be the kind of hands-on dad to this brood that he didn’t get to be for Ireland, who is now 22 and working as a model. His relations with his own siblings — three brothers, two sisters — ebb and flow. Right now, he’s welcomed his brother Daniel, no longer a “raging drug addict,” he says, back into his life; but he’s barely on speaking terms with Trump-supporting Stephen. “To me, he’s like Rolfe in The Sound of Music,” says Baldwin. “He’s just hanging out with the wrong crowd. I don’t know if we want to invite him to the Christmas caroling party.”\\nAs we weave our way downtown, I ask if there’s anything about his career that he wishes had turned out differently — if he looks at those of his heroes, serious, dramatic actors like Al Pacino or Robert De Niro, and wonders how his, decorated and impressive as it is, took a different turn.\\nHe shares a story that he put into his memoir, alongside tales of drug use (he’s been sober since 1985) and marital strife (yes, including the very unfatherly voicemail he once left Ireland, with whom he’s close now). It was the late ’80s, and a young Baldwin, still a few years shy of his breakout role in Glengarry Glen Ross, was sitting across from two Paramount executives in the studio’s commissary. They were trying to cajole him into doing Flight of the Intruder; but he’d been busy making The Hunt for Red October, which, as far as he was concerned, was the more compelling war film. So, he asked instead about the third Godfather movie, which had yet to cast its star. “I’ll never forget it. One of these guys looks to the other and goes, ‘I know what he wants. He wants the good stuff,\\'” says Baldwin. “I didn’t know what to say. I remember sitting there, going, ‘Yeah, that’s exactly what I want.’ And in that moment, I realized that these people have an agenda and if you get lucky enough where you’re Leo [DiCaprio] or you’re Jack Nicholson, and your agenda intersects with their agenda, great; otherwise …”\\nHe leaves the sentence incomplete.\\n“Most people don’t go to the moon,” he continues, staring wistfully out the window as the city whizzes by. “Most people fly planes around the Earth and maybe up into space, but not all the astronauts went to the moon, and it’s the same with movie stars. Not everybody gets to go as far as you can go. And I accept that. I do.”\\n***\\nWhen I meet him a few weeks later at the midtown studio where he’s been taping The Alec Baldwin Show, he seems different. Softer, maybe; definitely happier. It’s not hard to see he’s in his element, bounding through the halls with a camera crew in tow.\\n“We’re making a good show here,” he tells me, though Baldwin is savvy enough about the business to recognize it might not last. So he hedges: “I mean, who knows if we survive? ABC’s not doing very well. We could get out there, show four or five episodes, and be dead.”\\nBaldwin doesn’t get a lot of time to watch TV these days — save Don Lemon, who his wife is “madly in love with,” on CNN — which means he hasn’t surveyed the competition. Instead, he says his promotional tour for his memoir in the spring of 2017 gave him his best sense yet for what he wanted his show to be — and, just as important, what he didn’t want it to be.\\nThough he’s a loyal friend of Jimmy Fallon, he allowed himself to be booked on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show. At first, the conversation appeared to be going well. Baldwin, a famously good guest, shares a few made-for-late-night stories of his children and his Trump impression. A few minutes in, Colbert asks his permission to get a little more personal. Baldwin smiles, though on a second viewing (at his request), I see his trepidation. “You famously yelled at a paparazzo, more than one time,” Colbert says. “Sometimes you seem like an angry guy. But you’re handsome, you’re extremely talented, you’re wealthy … What made you angry?”\\nBaldwin plays along, regaling his host with a few doozies from his photographer run-ins over the years. Inside, he was seething. “I thought to myself, ‘Oh no, oh no, let’s not get into psychoanalyzing me, because I don’t think you’re qualified,\\'” he says now. “And you’ve just reminded me, in the briefest way, why I didn’t do this show all these years.”\\nMonths later, he’d take to Twitter to chide Colbert, as well as John Oliver, for becoming public scolds of the #MeToo era — for turning late-night TV from “promotional pit stops” and “blithe chitchat” to a “grand jury.” The stance earned him plenty of grief, but he stands by it. “If I want to talk about that stuff,” he explains, “I don’t necessarily want to talk about it with them.”\\nAnd yet, when Colbert asked, I say, he answered.\\n“If I don’t, I am the angry guy. You can’t win either way because people have already made up their minds. It’s either, ‘Alec Baldwin, I think you’re a philanthropic, wonderful citizen of the community, whatever talent you have’ or ‘Alec Baldwin, you’re just an asshole.’ And it’s never going to change.”\\nThe Alec Baldwin Show was conceived more in the Tomorrow Show vein — intimate, inoffensive conversations, or what ABC’s Mills describes as “the warm bath style of interviewing.” To Jason Schrift, who was brought over to run the show after years on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Baldwin’s perfectly suited for the job. “He’s the kind of guy you want to have at your dinner party,” says Schrift. “He’ll keep the conversation going and he can talk to anyone, and that’s exactly what you want.”\\nWhat will make it to air is still being sorted in late September, as is the guest list, which will range from Kim Kardashian to the prime minister of Norway. Mills is still hoping the show will land Trump and Justin Bieber, now Baldwin’s nephew after reportedly marrying his niece, Stephen’s daughter Hailey. (When I mention the Bieber idea to Baldwin, he looks surprised and then shakes his head no.) But it’s his interview with De Niro, a reliably underwhelming talk show guest, where I get to see Baldwin tested. After some friendly banter about their respective tennis games, he spends the hour doggedly plying stories from the iconic actor, managing to elicit a few special, if not exactly newsworthy, exchanges, including one that leaves both men teary. What the interview proves is that Baldwin — who pulls out his eerily good De Niro impression and tells a fabulous, profanity-laced story about the mob that ABC will surely cut — can carry an hour of television if he needs to.\\nWhen the show was first announced in March, Baldwin told me he’d be interested in having Rose McGowan on as a guest, too, despite “the long, steady piss” she’d taken on him in the past. But when I mention her name now, he’s clearly changed his mind. “She’s a tragic front person for [the #MeToo] cause,” he tells me, “and I say that because you don’t stand much of a chance of getting where you want to be if you’re going to arbitrarily alienate and excoriate innocent men. … It’s like all of a sudden, she’s one of the Crips — the head of her own gang.” He pauses, smiles, and adds: “You can print that, by the way.”\\nBaldwin has no intention of shying away from the topic, however — in fact, he says he’s begged Mira Sorvino to come on the show. When her history with Weinstein was revealed last fall, he thought to himself, “You know, I always wondered what happened to Mira Sorvino. She was so talented and so gorgeous, and then, my God, he torpedoed her career.” Now, he says, “I’d love to ask her about that: What was it like? It’s like The Sixth Sense, when they’re like, ‘I see dead people.’ When did you realize you were dead? That you’d been poisoned and killed?”\\nHe approaches the subject a little more gingerly with another guest, Kerry Washington, who comes by to tape her hour in late September. They’re talking about reviving a Whoopi Goldberg production on Broadway, when Baldwin works his way there. He doesn’t want to get this wrong, he says, sounding a familiar alarm. They both laugh, nervously, and then Baldwin dives in.\\nThis story first appeared in the Oct. 10 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe.'},\n",

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo - S1BEUCKILLAB\\nIt has been two years since the start of #MeToo. Image:\\xa0REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\\nReuters Staff\\nThis week marks two years since the New York Times and the New Yorker published accounts by multiple women accusing film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and a drive to empower women who work behind and in front of the camera.\\nWeinstein is due to stand trial in January on charges of rape and predatory assault of two women. He denies any non-consensual sex.\\nReuters asked actors, directors and producers how much Hollywood has changed since October 2017. Below are their replies, edited for length and clarity.\\nJULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS\\n\"I\\'d like to say that I feel like men might be beginning to behave themselves a little bit better, and I say maybe. I\\'m not saying they have definitively, but there is a new way of communicating, or a slightly new awareness, an awareness shift that\\'s happened. It\\'s in process. This job is not done. It will never be done, but I think there\\'s a way of communicating that has improved, hopefully.\"\\nPATRICIA ARQUETTE\\n\"The #MeToo movement - my sister was one of the first people to come out - and I think it\\'s had a ripple effect all across the world, beyond Hollywood. Luckily there is more representation of women and women of color on television than there was before, but it\\'s still not really equal yet ... Activists and people have been trying to get this work done for a long, long time, but the more we have this conversation, the more we ask for it, the more we talk about the need for it, the better. You have movies like \\'Wonder Woman\\' and \\'Black Panther\\' busting box office records and then suddenly, all of a sudden, the world is like \\'Oh, right, they could be successful.\\' The business is sometimes the last one to learn.\"\\nBRAD PITT\\n\"We seem to work as a pendulum. We swing too far one way, then we find that sweet spot, and then we go too far back and we keep on this swing. But what is going on, which is positive, is that we\\'re recalibrating our relationships, behaviors and workplace. It\\'s long overdue and needed, and it\\'s a good thing.\"\\nMICHELLE WILLIAMS\\n\"I\\'ve seen so many changes within my industry, but not just within my industry ... I see it at my daughter\\'s school. I see it in my friends\\' places of employment. I see it really everywhere, and it gives me great faith that the world that these girls are growing up in is going to be different than the one that you and I grew up in.\"\\nANGELINA JOLIE\\n\"I think we have very far to go. I think even in Hollywood there should have been an independent inquiry... There\\'s a lot of focus about what they say women want and I would say it\\'s not what we want. It\\'s what we\\'d like not to be done to us. Do not limit us to have an education, do not harm us whether it be at war or in our own homes, do not oppress us or try to control us, do not limit our possibilities as human beings and just let us be.\"\\nKRISTEN STEWART\\n\"There\\'s this solidarity that is providing women with a chance to start finally telling their own stories and not being used as sort of tools to tell their stories through other people ... There are so many untapped resources and ways in which we can inhabit our own stories and repossess our narrative. (It) is fully doable right now and for the first time, like ever, so it is an exciting time for women in film, like, enormously.\"\\nCARA DELEVINGNE\\n\"I think the #MeToo movement has changed a lot, but like a lot of hashtag movements, the problem is that when you do a hashtag or something, people think it\\'s fixed. But it\\'s not. It hasn\\'t really changed anything, because it\\'s still happening.\"\\nELISABETH MOSS\\n\"For me (on movie ‘The Kitchen,\\') we had (director) Andrea (Berloff), three female leads, we also had (the) first female (director of photography), and it\\'s almost one of those things now that\\'s become natural because these women are the best at what they do, and that\\'s why they were there and not because they\\'re women ... It\\'s just becoming more normalized, which I think is the best part of it.\"\\nNICOLE KIDMAN\\n\"Charlize (Theron), Margot (Robbie) and I just did a film - ‘Bombshell\\' - which is about instigating change in terms of sexual harassment ... We hope that constantly talking about it changes it for the generations to come.\"\\nJULIANNE MOORE\\n\"Because of Time\\'s Up, (New York) Governor (Andrew) Cuomo has adopted the Time\\'s Up safety agenda, which is really, really significant for every woman in New York state. New York is a much less progressive state than California, so when Time\\'s Up New York got together we thought, \\'What do we address here in our home state?\\' And we\\'ve really been able to make changes (including) extend the statute of limitations on assault.\"\\nMICHELLE PFEIFFER\\n\"I think there\\'s been such a seismic shift in awareness in just a year. I think there\\'s a long way to go but I do think quite a bit has happened already. Already all the conversations I\\'ve had with women, we just didn\\'t have those conversations before.\"\\nMELISSA MCCARTHY\\n\"I think we\\'re at the beginning of a movement, and I think we have to keep pushing. You can talk a good game, but you have to wait until it changes, so we\\'re not there yet. We will be. You\\'ve got to root for it. I\\'m a hopeful person. I have two daughters; I have to be. I\\'ll fight. I\\'ll fight until I can\\'t fight anymore.\"\\nELLE FANNING\\n\"For me, being a young woman in the industry and hearing actresses tell their story and being able to hear those voices and know that it\\'s OK to speak your truth on things and stand up for what\\'s right and say no - it\\'s a great community that has really formed because of this.\"\\nKIRSTIE ALLEY\\n\"When we did \\'Cheers,\\' ... if someone was in the bathroom, someone would kick open the door and we would take pictures, but the intent was in fun. And if the intent is to hold you hostage or not give you a job without sexual favors, you know the difference. But I think that the pendulum swung and now it needs to swing and balance out because people are not all ill-intentioned.\"\\nJULIETTE BINOCHE\\n\"I have been quite free, always, in my choices in life. I didn\\'t need #MeToo to do that, but I think #MeToo\\'s movement was very important for some people, for some women to speak out.\"\\nRUTH NEGGA\\n\"You really shouldn\\'t be able to get away with inequality anymore. The thing is that you\\'ve got to keep vocal about it; you\\'ve got to be vigilant. It\\'s not something that can ever be really done and dusted until there is equality and everybody\\'s voice is heard.\"\\nRICHARD LINKLATER\\n\"It\\'s just good everybody\\'s aware. I mean, out with the old, right? The old status quo can\\'t hold. There has to be these evolutionary leaps in what is acceptable.\"\\nDon\\'t miss any update on this topic\\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\\nSign up for free\\nLicense and Republishing\\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\\nStay up to date:\\nSDG 05: Gender Equality\\nShare:\\nThe Big Picture\\nExplore and monitor how SDG 05: Gender Equality is affecting economies, industries and global issues\\nWorld Economic Forum logo\\nForum Stories newsletter\\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\\nSubscribe today\\nAI fashion show highlights how digital access can empower women in\\xa0Pakistan\\nHarrison Lung and Hatem Bamatraf\\nMay 7, 2025\\n1:04\\nAI At Work: Who Benefits More?\\nAbout us\\nEngage with us\\nSign in\\nPartner with us\\nBecome a member\\nSign up for our press releases\\nSubscribe to our newsletters\\nContact us\\nQuick links\\nLanguage editions\\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Service\\nSitemap\\n© 2025 World Economic Forum'},\n",

       "  'text': \"It’s debatable if flies can pass H. pylori | UCLA Health It’s debatable if flies can pass H. pylori\\nFly transmitting diseases\\nDear Doctors: In your recent column about gastritis, you didn't mention the possibility of getting H. pylori from flies. I was diagnosed with H. pylori decades ago, and soon after I saw a video in the doctor's waiting room about its connection to flies. I now go to war with any flies in the house.\\nDear Reader: For those who haven't read that column, a reader diagnosed with gastritis asked for information about the condition. They also wondered how they may have acquired the infection that often causes it.\\nThe term gastritis refers to inflammation, irritation or swelling of the mucosa in the stomach. That's the layer of specialized cells that line the stomach. The mucosa is also where glands that secrete digestive juices are located. Because the enzymes and acids involved in digestion are so corrosive, the mucosa has several defense mechanisms that protect its cells from damage. These defenses also fend off infectious agents that someone might ingest, including bacteria and viruses. If these protections become weakened, or are somehow evaded, damage to the stomach lining can occur.\\nH. pylori, a bacterium that is the most common cause of chronic gastritis, is able to get past the mucosa's defenses. It takes up residence beneath the mucosa, in what is known as the epithelial layer of the stomach, and causes a persistent infection. This can cause the mucosa to increase production of stomach acid and lead to the inflammation, pain and other symptoms associated with gastritis. Only a portion of H. pylori infections, about 20%, cause symptoms.\\nThe bacteria also puts people at risk of developing an ulcer, which is an open sore in the mucosa. It is estimated that, if left untreated, up to 10% of those living with an H. pylori infection go on to develop an ulcer. There is also a link between H. pylori infection and some stomach cancers.\\nSo how does an H. pylori infection occur? No one is really sure. The main method of transport is suspected to be through direct contact with contaminated saliva, stool or vomit. Food or water that contains the bacteria may also be a source of infection. And that's where the housefly comes in. Houseflies, which feed on feces, defecate and regurgitate when they land on something. This led researchers in Boston to ask if flies can become carriers of H. pylori and leave the bacteria behind on surfaces they touch. Experiments they conducted in the late 1990s led them to conclude that it is possible. However, a number of subsequent studies have disputed those findings.\\nAlthough the housefly as a vector of H. pylori remains a subject of debate, there is little doubt these pests can pose a threat to human health. In addition to human and animal fecal matter, houseflies feed on spoiled and rotting meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and they seek out the pus and other discharges from open wounds. They are believed to transmit scores of diseases, including cholera, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and dysentery. Whatever the final answer regarding H. pylori proves to be, your vigilance against houseflies is making your home safer.\\n(Send your questions to [email\\xa0protected], or write: Ask the Doctors, c/o UCLA Health Sciences Media Relations, 10960 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1955, Los Angeles, CA, 90024.

       "  'text': '\"The casting couch is real\": Author Karina Longworth on Hollywood\\'s long history of power abuse | Salon.com \"The casting couch is real\": Author Karina Longworth on Hollywood\\'s long history of power abuse\\nThe author of a new book on Howard Hughes\\' Hollywood reveals its pre-#MeToo history\\nBy Mary Elizabeth Williams\\nSenior Writer\\nPublished November 17, 2018 1:00PM (EST)\\n\"Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes\\'s Hollywood\" by Karina Longworth (Harper Collins/Emily Berl)\\n\"Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes\\'s Hollywood\" by Karina Longworth (Harper Collins/Emily Berl)\\nIf you want to trace the evolution of Hollywood over the course of its most formative decades, look at the life of one man. Spoiler: It\\'s really a story about women.\\nIn \"Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes\\'s Hollywood,\" author Karina Longworth views the dream factory through the life of Howard Hughes, the mogul whose on screen productions and offscreen relationships with some of the industry\\'s most iconic female figures — including Jean Harlow, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and Lana Turner — molded the industry.\\nLongworth, host of the addictive podcast\\xa0\"You Must Remember This,\"\\xa0says the book was a natural outgrowth of the show. For the book, she focused on expanding her work on three episodes she called \"The Many Loves of Howard Hughes,\" about women with really disparate Hollywood experiences who had all been involved with Howard Hughes, either professionally, personally, or both. She knew there had to be even more women whose stories\\xa0could be told.\\n\"That would be a way of hanging a portrait of what it was like to be a woman in Hollywood during this period that historians call the classical Hollywood era, which was just coincidentally exactly the length of time that Howard Hughes was active in Hollywood,\" she says.\\xa0\"He arrives at the end of the silent era as the studios are consolidating their power. He starts to disappear at the late 1950s, as the studios had lost power to television and to cultural changes. It was an interesting lens on so many other things.\"\\nAs Longworth\\'s book makes clear, the man whose name is on the cover is the backbone, not the main attraction. \"I never thought of it as a Howard Hughes biography,\" she says. \"It was never really to me his story. His story is just the skeleton that would give form to the stories of the women. It was always supposed to be about seeing this world of Hollywood through these women’s eyes. On a really simple level, I wanted to say who these women were before Howard Hughes came into their lives, how he changed their lives and careers and just show a little bit of what happened after.\"\\nBrimming with what Longworth\\'s listeners will recognize as \"secret and/or forgotten\" tales of Hollywood\\'s early years, \"Seduction\" is a luxuriously deep dive, one that meticulously acknowledges the fuzzy edges between lore and verifiable fact. Throughout, the author pauses to note when accounts of events vary, or players in the story likely self-mythologized.\\n\"I don’t know that people want to hear this,\" Longworth says, \"because they want to think that people like me are uncovering the buried truth that nobody has ever known before. But in a lot of these cases, there is no truth left that’s buried because everybody’s dead. All we have are these narratives that were recorded either at the time things were happening or in some cases, through memoirs that were released years later.\"\\n\"Either way, everything is filtered in its narrow perspective — if it’s not just straight up publicity, which is usually mostly lies,\" she adds.\\xa0\"It’s very, very difficult to know what is absolutely the truth, but I have a lot of experience reading through this stuff on the podcast. I just tried to be very transparent when I don’t know what the truth is.\"\\nAs Longworth explains it,\\xa0what she tries to do is not\\xa0definitively\\xa0declare what the truth of an event was,\\xa0but to figure out why certain stories were told, and told in the ways that they were — whether\\xa0it\\'s a\\xa0narrative put out by a publicist or studio, or a columnist\\'s interpretation, or an artist in her autobiography.\\nComing a year into the #MeToo movement, as the industry is still reckoning with its legacy of abuses of power, \"Seduction\" feels like an especially modern tome. It\\'s a story of abuses of power, but also of women who managed to\\xa0persist and even succeed\\xa0within the constraints of a system stacked against them.\\n\"There’s nothing in the book that’s directly influenced by the #Me Too movement,\" says Longworth. \"The book is what it was always going to be, because I’ve been living with this material for years.\"\\n\\xa0\\nBut, she adds, \"I hope that people will be able to understand that the conversations that we’re having now about the exploitation of women in all kinds of professional environments — including Hollywood — are not conversations that we’ve been able to have in the past. We were unable to have these conversations ten years ago, let alone\\xa050 years ago, a hundred years ago.\"\\n\\xa0\\nThe reasons why these conversations were silenced are as complex as the conversations\\xa0themselves.\\n\"There are a lot of factors, including this control that studios had over their contract players and the way the publicity system worked. And the casting couch, it is a real thing,\" says Longworth. \"I talk about different ways in which it worked that are maybe not the ways that people have in their heads, like Howard Hughes’ network of spies going around the country procuring women for him.\\xa0I hope that people will find it sad as I do in the book. There are no stories of out-and-out rape or anything like that in the book; it’s more this systematic treating of women like they’re disposable and like they’re not human. That’s the stuff that is really heartbreaking to me.\"\\nYet \"Seduction\" also introduces the reader to fascinating women who did wield creative power, including female filmmakers like Ida Lupino, whose legacy is part of Hollywood history.\\n\"One thing that became really clear comparing and contrasting a lot of women’s stories is the extent to which women who wanted to work as writers or directors often had to align themselves with a powerful man and usually that was a man who was her husband,\" says Longworth.\\nLongworth also acknowledges that as we examine the lives and behaviors of historical figures, we have to decide for ourselves how to approach their work. As she does on her podcast, she discusses hushed up scandals, racially insensitive casting choices and blatant sexism, all while also looking at the artistic\\xa0merits\\xa0of the output itself.\\n\"We have over a hundred years of film history that we haven’t looked at from this perspective,\" she says. \"I don’t think that there’s anything productive that could come out of avoiding it. Howard Hughes is long gone. He’s not going to make any money if we watch \\'The Outlaw.\\' I just think that this is history and what we need to understand in history. I hope that it is actually easier to be able to have these nuanced conversations about the past than it is about the present.\"\\n\"I understand why somebody would never want to watch a Miramax movie,\" she adds, \"but hopefully in the future we’ll be able to have more perspective to be able to unpack the thorny things that are happening right now.\"\\nBy Mary Elizabeth Williams\\nMary Elizabeth Williams is a senior writer for Salon and author of \"A Series of Catastrophes & Miracles.\" Follow her on Bluesky\\xa0@maryelizabethw.\\nMORE FROM Mary Elizabeth Williams'},\n",

       "  'text': '#MeToo moves from social media to the streets with march in Hollywood on Sunday - Los Angeles Times Advertisement\\n#MeToo moves from social media to the streets with march in Hollywood on Sunday\\nSurvivors of sexual assault and harassment gathered Wednesday to announce the “Me Too Survivors’ March” slated for Sunday in Hollywood. The event grew from the “Me Too” social media campaign following accusations made by actresses against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n(Ruben Vives / Los Angeles Times)\\nSurvivors of sexual assault and harassment gathered Wednesday in Beverly Hills to announce the “Me Too Survivors’ March” on Sunday afternoon in Hollywood.\\nAs traffic moved slowly along Wilshire Boulevard, more than a dozen women and men stood together, holding signs that read “#MeToo March” and “#Endthestigma.”\\nThe group was there to announced the march, to run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue in Hollywood. The event is in response to the #MeToo campaign, a social media movement that grew out of accusations by actresses against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and encouraged other women from various backgrounds to share their stories.\\nAdvertisement\\n“This goes beyond Hollywood,” said Brenda Gutierrez, the lead organizer of the march. “I think it’s time that we’re no longer silenced, no longer shamed and that we can end the stigma and I think that’s a big message of this march.”\\n“If one person can come out and seek help, then I’ll be happy,” Gutierrez said.\\nShe said the idea of the event came last month when she followed Alyssa Milano’s Twitter request that women tell their stories of sexual harassment or assault with the hashtag #MeToo.\\nAdvertisement\\nGutierrez said she shared the tweet on her Facebook account, used the hashtag #MeToo and left to attend a rally against President’s Trump’s travel ban involving several Muslim countries. When she got home and checked her Facebook account she saw more than 40 women she knew had come forward about their experiences.\\n“I wasn’t surprised because I know it happens a lot,” she said. “It’s sad, but why are we only talking about it when someone famous is talking about it?”\\nGutierrez said the hashtag and movement opened up old wounds about her own personal experiences. After seeing the number of women who responded to her Facebook message she decided that there should be a place for all survivors to gather.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Sexual violence is an epidemic that touches the lives of survivors beyond the predominantly white and wealthy Hollywood celebrities that have come forward with allegations against Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein,” said Hussain Turk, a survivor of rape and sexual battery. “And the perpetrators aren’t just the exceptionally few and rich white men who occupy influential positions of fame and power.”\\nAmong other issues brought up at the press conference was the death of 26-year-old Gemmel Moore, who was found dead at the home of Ed Buck, a high-profile political activist and contributor to the Democratic Party in California and Los Angeles County.\\nSupporting the group was Chelsea Byers, chair of the Campaign To End the Statute of Limitations on Rape and Sexual Assault. Byers said the campaign targets statute of limitation laws in 30 U.S. states.\\n“If you’re raped in the state of Pennsylvania, you have 12 years to report that crime,” she said. “ If you’re raped in the state of Arizona, there’s no time limit.”\\n“The statute of limitations are among the most heinous of gagging mechanisms codified into law. These arbitrary time limits exist in 30 U.S. states and effectively eliminate the possibility for any justice through our legal system.”\\nAdvertisement\\nGutierrez, the lead organizer, said she hopes the march will help her heal from her own experiences and hopes it will also help unite other survivors.\\nruben.vives@latimes.com\\nFor more Southern California news, follow @latvives on Twitter.\\nAdvertisement'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Vanessa Hudgens Cosmopolitan UK interview  From teen sensation to blockbuster leading lady, Vanessa Hudgens has proved herself the master of reinvention. But, asks Nicola Fahey... what’s next?\\nVanessa Hudgens is the sort of woman it would be very easy to just... hate. At only 31 years old, she’s already had the kind of career most of us dream of. She got to kiss Zac Efron on-screen for three years – and off-screen for another two. She got a blockbuster trilogy, High School Musical, under her belt by the time she was 19, owns two homes and lives in harmony with her equally successful actor boyfriend of eight years, Austin Butler. And this month she’s starring alongside Will Smith in the biggest action sequel of the year, Bad Boys For Life.\\nOK, so she started grafting at 14 years old when most of us were still working out which lipliner best suited us (answer: none of them), cementing her place in Hollywood as Gabriella Montez in High School Musical a year later – but it didn’t stop there. While it would have been easy to bask in the glory of her Disney fame, Hudgens, it turns out, is not a fan of doing what’s expected of her. It’s for this reason that, far from being hated, she has instead managed to amass global respect from both her fans and critics alike.\\nHair, Face, Photograph, Facial expression, Beauty, Smile, Lip, Skin, Long hair, Eye, pinterest\\nCosmopolitan UK\\nIt’s 11am in LA and Hudgens has woken up in her own bed, in her palatial Mediterranean-style mansion, for the first time in as long as she can remember. She has signed out of 2019 with the release of her second Netflix film, The Knight Before Christmas, following the success of The Princess Switch. Before that, post-High School Musical fame, she deliberately avoided getting typecast by playing the Disney-departing role of Candy, a hard-partying, gun-toting bad girl, alongside fellow former squeaky- clean stars Selena Gomez and Ashley Benson in 2013’s Spring Breakers. And yet it turns out even movie stars aren’t immune from the stresses of adulting.\\nImage no longer available\\n\"I definitely feel more anxiety now than I ever have in my entire life. You become an adult and shit gets real. I have two mortgages and I’m spending way more money than I would like to spend – I think all of that bullshit really takes a toll on your wellbeing. Paying your taxes – all of this adult shit that you don’t have to deal with when you’re a kid, you can live young and free, then it all kind of... goes away.\"\\nIf you look at other stars who were catapulted into the limelight at the same age (or younger), you realise that things could have been far worse than a few life-admin-related sleepless nights. So how did she avoid the curse of the child star that affected those like Lindsay Lohan, Mischa Barton and Britney Spears who came before her?\\nImage no longer available\\n\"Looking back, it feels like another lifetime. I mean, I’m tired for sure. I take good care of myself. I know the things that matter the most – I do love my job, but my job isn’t everything. My family is – my partner and my friends are the things that keep me grounded.\"\\nThe partner in question isn’t Efron, who she split with in 2010 following a five-year relationship. Hudgens tells me she hasn’t \"seen him or spoken to him in years\", although she still has the T necklace his character Troy gave Gabriella in the first movie.“I feel like I need to sell it for charity because it’s literally sitting in a little bag rusting!\"\\nNo, it’s actually another HSM alumni, Butler, who she’s been with since 2011, that informs a huge part of her life now. \"It’s eight years this year – FaceTime, good communication, respect and trust [are what keep us going]. The longest we’ve been apart was four months. It sucks! You start hating hearing yourself say \\'I miss you.\\' But if it’s your person, you make it work.”\\nBut it’s not just Butler who keeps her feet on the ground. Since finding fame at such a young age, Hudgens – who was raised in California by her mum, Gina, an office worker born in the Philippines, and late father, Greg, a firefighter – credits her sensible streak to the meticulous support network she has built around her.\\n\"I think you become who you surround yourself with, so I think it’s really important to have a group of friends that reflects the type of person you want to be. I’ve never been one for LA clubs. I actually despise [them] – I love a good rave. I’m like, take me to New York or Berlin and put me underground in a warehouse with lasers and smoke machines and I’ll be living my best life. That’s something that makes me who I am and allows my soul to flourish.\\nImage no longer available\\n\"I was also a really shy kid. I love acting and being on the stage and hiding behind a character, but when it came to me, Vanessa, being out there, I was never one for that – and it’s something I’m still getting used to. I think being a shy kid really helped me not go down the wrong path – being a bit antisocial, literally.\"\\nThis shyness was famously tested in 2007 when Hudgens became one of the first wave of stars to have their privacy breached by a nude photo leak. At the time, there wasn’t much public sympathy for the then-Disney Channel star, and rather than being perceived as a victim whose privacy had been grossly violated, she was blamed for having taken compromising photos and forced to apologise for something that she had no control over.\\n\"It was a really traumatising thing for me. It’s really f*cked up that people feel like they are entitled enough to share something that personal with the world. As an actor, you completely lose all grip of your own privacy and it’s really sad. It feels like that shouldn’t be the case, but unfortunately if enough people are interested, they’re going to do everything they can to get to know as much about you as they can, which is flattering, I guess, but then people take it too far and end up divulging things that should be personal.\\n\"I think that is because there’s a disconnect when you see your favourite actress on the screen, and you see them now on your TV in your homes, and you can watch them whenever you want. There’s almost – I don’t want to say lack of respect because that sounds negative – but it just makes you feel like you know them even though you don’t.\"\\n\"I\\'ve always been a big advocate of being true to yourself\"\\nLooking back now, with the benefit of hindsight, it feels like this moment may have been the making of the person she is today; which, despite the Disney backstory and “typical” leading lady roles is – make no mistake – a badass professional who swears like a trooper and takes zero shit from anyone. I found this out myself when I brought up the topic of the #MeToo movement in Hollywood, expecting some agent-approved PC line. Instead?\\n\"I have been talked to in ways that are not appropriate. I have been in situations where I’ve been talked to in inappropriate ways, but right then, in that moment, I was the person to just say, \\'No. Why would you say that? You’re completely out of line.\\' I’m the type of person in any situation, whether it’s an audition or in work, if I feel uncomfortable, I’m going to walk away or let that person know they’re making me feel uncomfortable. Then, if they don’t respect that, they can go f*ck off. If someone doesn’t like that, literally they can f*ck off. As long as you hold your ground, no one will bring you down.\"\\nHudgens pauses to catch her breath, almost surprised by her sudden release of emotion. \"I’ve always been a big advocate of being true to yourself. Not everyone is going to like that – well, good. That makes you an individual. That makes you unique. And if we’re all the same, what’s the point? It’s important to look out for each other, especially in this industry, and realise it’s tough. It’s hard enough, nobody needs to make it harder.\"\\nBeing that positive, that firm and resilient, takes annual investment – starting in January each year. “To me, [New Year] is a time of rebirth and new beginnings. I feel like it’s a time where I have a clean slate and have 365 days ahead of me that I can really be intentional with what I’m doing\\nI make a vision board every January 1st. I print out a bunch of photos, places I want to go to, how much money I want to save, what kind of films I want to do, the people I want to work with, and then I put it up on my wall and see it every day and know what I’m working towards.\\n\"If you’re putting yourself out there, you will be subject to criticism. That’s just how it is\"\\n\"I’ve done that for the past four years now, and it’s pretty amazing how when you’re extremely intentional about what you want and want to do, at the end of the year you end up checking off a lot of the things on your vision board. I also reward myself when I do get those things done. I’m a big advocate of patting yourself on the back. I look at myself in the mirror and say, \\'Hey girl, you are crushing it.\\'\"\\nAnd crushing it she most definitely is. Whatever the future holds for Vanessa Hudgens, it’s clear that having packed so much into her (already) decade-and- a-half-long career, she now feels no need to dance to the beat of anyone else’s drum.\\n\"If you’re putting yourself out there, you will be subject to criticism. That’s just how it is. You have to deal with it the best that you can in a way that is healthy for you.\"\\nWith an estimated £10 million banked, 21 films under her belt and two more on the way, Hudgens has gone from teen icon to bona-fide Hollywood film star by the age most of us have just about worked out how to renew our TV licence. And with 2020 set to be her biggest year to date, it’s safe to say her reinvention is far from over yet.\\nImage no longer available'},\n",

The model works with Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome, so your gaming machine of choice shouldn\\'t matter.\\nKinesis Freestyle Edge\\nKinesis Freestyle Edge\\nBest ergonomic gaming keyboard\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nDo ergonomic keyboards really help?\\nThey aren\\'t a blanket solution for preventing wrist problems, but they can help reduce strain for some users. Don\\'t buy an ergonomic keyboard expecting it to be the perfect answer — instead, talk to your doctor if you have long-term typing pain, and always try out an ergonomic design before you buy it. If it makes your wrists feel better, it\\'s a good purchase. If you haven\\'t tried a wrist rest on a traditional keyboard yet, that\\'s also an option worth exploring.\\nHow do I choose a good ergonomic keyboard?\\nIn addition to trying out ergonomic designs to see if they physically help, it\\'s important to look for a keyboard that has durable, responsive keys that feel good when you type. Membrane keyboards, for example, may offer more protection from spills and dust, but the squishy keys may not be the best for ergonomic use.\\nWe picked our keyboards based on reviews of how they actually perform and how they can help reduce pain. They also pair well with an ergonomic mouse. If your ergonomic keyboard doesn\\'t come with a wrist pad, consider adding one — like Razer\\'s Wrist Rest — to your desk setup to help alleviate wrist strain. If you\\'re working in environments with dimmer ambient lighting, you may also want to choose a keyboard with adjustable keyboard backlighting to help reduce eye strain while typing, especially if you\\'re not used to the positioning of key placement on a split design. Additionally, if you\\'re investing in an ergonomic keyboard, be sure to evaluate your overall workspace. Is your monitor at the proper height for the keyboard placement? If it\\'s too low, consider getting risers to raise your monitor or mount your display to an adjustable stand. A standing desk can also help improve ergonomics in your workspace.\\nWhat makes a good ergonomic keyboard?\\nGood ergonomic keyboards also have grips to stay firmly planted on your desk, tilting options to adjust (including reverse tilting to help your wrists find a more natural position), and optional wrist pads for the front of the keyboard. Keymapping and easily replaceable keys also are great features. Mechanical keyboards are popular for their responsive, fully mechanical switches, but not everyone likes them. The keyboard we prefer has shallow keys that require little movement to reach, which will reduce typing pain over time. Numeric keyboards also are important if your job requires one.\\nDo Microsoft ergonomic keyboards work with Mac?\\nYes and no. You’ll be able to pair the keyboard and use it for typing. Since you’re not using the proprietary software, you might lose some additional features like keymapping or the ability to change settings (most gaming keyboards come with that as standard). If you can remap keys, you’ll have to remap the Option, Control, and Alt keys to match the Command key setup that MacOS keyboards use.\\nAre split keyboards more ergonomic?\\nThey’re not necessarily more ergonomic, but they’re worth a try if it feels comfortable to you. The split keyboard with a wavy design is popular because many people find it works for the way they hold their wrists. Your mileage may vary, but it’s a good place to start.\\nHow long does it take to get used to an ergonomic keyboard?\\nIt shouldn’t take long, but make sure you give it a good try before deciding to keep it or get rid of it. An ergonomic keyboard isn’t as big of a change as it may seem at first glance, and you can adjust with practice, but it usually takes a week or two before the unique shape and hand placement for certain ergonomic keyboards begins to feel natural again.\\nWhat can I do to make a keyboard more ergonomic?\\nAs a general rule, make sure your wrists are above the keyboard. That could mean using a keyboard tray so the keyboard is significantly lower, or raising up your seat so you have a height advantage. You can also try holding your arms at a more neutral angle, rather than close to 90 degrees to the keyboard, and make sure that your wrists and forearms line up comfortably. Adding an ergonomic mouse to your setup can also help alleviate strain wrist and shoulder strain.\\nIf positioning is very important to you, you may want to take a look at our list of the best wireless keyboards, too.\\nTyler Lacoma\\nIf it can be streamed, voice-activated, made better with an app, or beaten by mashing buttons, Tyler\\'s into it.

       "  'text': 'Ergo-Hart Västrik THE HEATHENS IN TARTU IN 1987-1994: HERITAGE PROTECTION CLUB TÕLET\\nErgo-Hart Västrik. Tartu\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Some comments on Zhivile\\'\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Ramoshkaite-Sverdioliene\\'s speech\\n\\xa0 \\xa0The Archaic Patterns of Modern Life\\n\\xa0 \\xa0on the Conference of Contemporary\\n\\xa0 \\xa0Folklore in Tartu, Nov. 3, 1995.*\\nSimilar to the Lithuanian Romuva is the Estonian movement that is most commonly called maausulised (followers of the indigenous religion maausk, lit. the \\'faith of the earth\\') or taara usulised(\\' followers of Taara faith\\'). The appellation taarausu lised refers to the connection with the devotees of Taara who were active in Estonia in the 1930s and who invented the Estonian national religion - the Taara faith1, which saw as its ideological foundation the perceivable deity with the name of Taara2. The words maausk and maausulised ensue from the name maarahvas (\\'country people\\', the indigenous inhabitants living in the country as opposed to foreigners who populated the towns), signifying the Estonians and Votes, but also from the words maakeel (\\'vernacular\\') and maajumal (\\'earth spirit\\') (see Eller 1990). The appellation maausulised is preferred by those participants in the movement who wish to make a distinction between themselves and the former devotees of Taara and thus to stress their resting upon their ancestors\\' heritage.3 (The latter can be treated as more general term and for the purposes of this article and in order to save space and avoid long and unwieldy circumlocutions, \"the faith of the earth\", maausk, and similar phenomena will be called Heathenism, and here the word will denote local ethnic forms of religion that have been attempted to restore on the basis of pre-Christian beliefs. The adherents of these religions shall be called the Heathens, i.e. followers of these particular forms of heathen religion. Both terms are capitalised, to avoid confusion with the general concept of heathenism, and to mark that here they are to be taken on an equal basis with the terms Christianity/Christian, and suchlike.)\\nThe movement of Heathens itself has never been uniform or centralised, therefore it contains smaller groups that have identified themselves or have been identified by others under different names at different periods (e.g. noortaaralased \\'young Taara followers\\', muinastaaralased \\'ancient Taara followers\\', metsausidised \\'followers of the faith of the woods\\', loodususulised \\'adherents of the natural religion\\', karvased \\'the shaggies\\', etc.) The following is a survey of the activities of one such group gathered into heritage protection club Tõlet in Tartu, Estonia. At the end of the article the general background and reasons of the Heathen movement is analysed, trying to view the movement in a wider cultural farmework.\\nBetween 1987 and 1994 Tartu heritage protection club Tõlet played an important role in the whole Heathen movement in Estonia and in the formation of its image outside the movement; the aim of the club was to preserve, study and disseminate our ancient culture in Estonia and elsewhere (Tõlet 1992,40). The club functioned as an open fellowship that united people with shared views, published its journal, organised public rituals, lectures and spring schools, studied the heritage of the Estonian. and its kindred peoples and, especially at the early stages of its existence, propagated and manifested powerfully the Heathen and Taara doctrine world outlook. Tõlet can be considered a kind of brain trust, an axis of functioning that strove to become the choice part in a movement that was much wider. Although the number of the club members did not exceed 15-20, the number of those joined in for to the activities was several times larger (e.g. in 1992 register of the Tõlet spring school in the Samma Grove showed more than 130 participants). Through publications, public events and TV programmes the name of the Heathens has been driven home both to the institutions dealing with the folk heritage and to a wider audience. Since the Heathens are, in a way, bearers, revivers and interpreters of the more ancient tradition, their experience should be of interest to folklorists.\\nTõlet was founded as a fellowship of young men that attracted new members mainly through personal contacts. Those who joined were people who felt the inclination to do so. When the feeling of communion or the need for it disappeared, they left.4 Unlike Romuva in Lithuania, there was no official organnisation In Estonia untl the vary resent times that would unify the majority of the adherents and represent them legally - the grouping remained a constantly changing and free association.5\\nThe centre and, in a way, the medium of functioning for Tõlet was Tartu University - information was disseminated on the notice boards there and acquaintances were also made there. The majority of the followers of the Heathen movement in Tartu were students. There were students of philology, history, geography, biology, physics, and other specialities (of course, there were more of those who studied specialities connected with national heritage, such as folklore and ethnology, but also a great number of students of biology). Age, sex, status or creed were no obstacles. There were also a small number of elder people in the Heathen movement, their authority within the group was significant and they built the image of the whole movement to a considerable degree.\\nTõlet was founded in Tartu in 1987 as a heritage protection club at a period when the number of various societies and clubs, both newly founded and re-established, skyrocketed. It was a period of \"thaw\", full of confusion, a time of the second national awakening and of the so-called singing revolution. Being directed at primeval culture, Tõlet was an exception in the general heritage protection movement that was mostly aimed at the heritage of the 1920s and 1930s. At the same time, the founders of the club have said that the information about Taara faith determined the aim and \"mentality\" of the club. The first pieces of knowledge were found in the press (e.g. Arjakas 1987, Deemant 1988), followed by direct contacts with the authors of the articles and the former devotees of Taara faith (Jüri-Rajur Liivak, Addold Mossin, Arvu Karjatse, etc.). Members of Tõlet started to do study and propagate the teachings of the Taara followers: the first issue of Tõlet\\'s journal Videvik6 published a number of writings from the former devotees and documents of the religious society Hiis. Thus the group came to be called noortaaralased - i.e. young followers of Taara faith.\\nThe young Heathens took the Taara movement as an example, but it was no mere imitation. The devotees of Taara can be characterised as the modellers of a new, Estonian faith that was to support the Estonian statehood and lay a new, firm spiritual foundation to it (Kaasik 1993a, 4). Tõlet\\'s objectives at the beginning of its activities were also emphatically cultural and political, aimed at masses and directed to the future. However, the cultural situation was different from that of the 1920s and 1930s, and so were the notions about the ancient beliefs: a number of comprehensive works concerning the Estonian spiritual folk tradition, including folk belief, had been published. Great was the influence of older Heathens, whose silent but unwavering promulgation of their ideas did not pass unnoticed - for example, the use and propagation of vernacular personal names (e.g. Sarv & Eller 1987), the publication of Sirvilauad (traditional Estonian runic calendar), which they used to disseminate their ideas of the ancestors\\' folk calendar (see, Kymme aastat... 1988), and the publication of essays condemning the general orientation of national culture (e.g. Eller 1990 and 1991). Tõlet began to identify itself increasingly with the name maausulised (\\'Heathens\\').\\nThe Heathens, not unlike the devotees of Taara, have offered an alternative to the mainstream national elite culture that since the proclamations of the Noor-Eesti movement has manifested a strive towards Europe.7 Heathens founded their identity on a different ground. Extracting ideas from the works of the ideologists of Taara faith, such as K. Utuste and J. Luiga, folklorist 0. Loorits and theologian U. Masing, they declared that the manifestations of the western (Indo-European) civilisation and culture were inherently totally alien and thus unsuited to the Estonians (descendants of maarahvas - \\'country people\\') and that these had been imported into Estonia by force by Baltic German Christianisation (see Barkalaja 1993). According to their ideas, native identity was to be established on native culture and not on alien examples. This found its expression among other things on the formation of the definition and division of time.\\nThe Heathens, like the followers of Taara, used their own reckoning of time: for the devotees of Taara the starting point was the proclamation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 AD, for Heathens and Tõlet the so-called birth of the earth8 in 8213 BC. Both have propagated the use of vernacular names for calendar months: I helmekuu/sydakuu9, II radokuu. III urbekuu (linnukuu), IV mahlakuu, V Iehekuu, VI õilmekuu/ pärnakuu (leedokuu), VII heinakuu, VIII lõikuskuu (põimikuu), IX sügiskuu, X hingedekuu/porikuu, XI talvekuu/kooljakuu, XII jõulukuu (Ülevaade... 1933, 90 and Aasta... 1990). Also, both movements have celebrated somewhai unusual festivals. The festival calendar of the Taara followers includes besides the holidays connected with the independence of the Republic of Estonia (Independence Day 24. II, Day of the Cross of Freedom 30. V, Peace Day - anniversary of the end of the War of Independence and commemoration of the fallen heroes 3.1) also days connected with the ancient Estonian struggle for independence (St. George\\'s night 23. IV, Lembitu\\'s Day 21. IX) and folk calendar festivals, whereas the latter are given a wider interpretation (e.g. urbepäev \\'Palm Sunday\\' - veneration of the elders and celebration of the beginning of spring 23. IV/I. V, kevadpüha \\'spring festival\\' - the day when the full installation of spring is marked with ploughing 5/18. V, suvistepühad \\'Whitsunday\\' - beginning of summer 9-1 1. VI, hiiepühad \\'Grove Festival\\' - celebration of the victory of light and valour 23-24. VI, kalmuhiie päev \\'Day of the Burial Grove\\' - celebration of the beginning of the Souls\\' Visiting Time 30. X, Yuletide — winter solstice and the day of winter pleasure 24-27. XII).10 The runic calendar (Sirvilauad) that reflects the Heathen calendar is mainly based on folk calendar festivals; the names of these festivals are chosen as vernacular as possible, trying to avoid those that imply Christian holidays.11 More magnificent was the celebration of equinoxes and solstices by the Heathens on the correct dates, although their celebration in the folk calendar had shifted to other days.\\nTõlet, like the devotees of Taara, published their newsletter, organised public lectures and events. The followers of Taara faith had an elaborate set of uniform attributes (urituli - sacrificial fire, tõlet - an amulet of silver and gold, containing the earth from the owner\\'s birthplace, tubane hiis \\'indoor holy grove\\' - kind a site with some plants inside the room for rituals, stylised folk costumes) and magical rites (initiation of new members, weddings, funerals). Unlike the followers of Taara faith, the Heathens have not attempted to define the objects of veneration very clearly and unambiguously, to canonise these as the only true ones. They were united primarily by common undertakings and activities, and they had developed a feeling of solidarity. Smaller groups developed their own customs and traditions. For example, the current form of communication between the members of Tõlet was to get together on Thursdays; in springs Tõlet organised the conventions at the holy grove of Samma in Viru-Nigula parish; the Heathen weddings of the members of Tõlet have always been memorable (e.g. Ahto and Mairi Kaasiks\\' wedding at Soemõisa in summer 1992, where several uniting rites were conducted; the wedding party lasted three days and nights, as was the tradition). A ceremonial tradition was the celebration of the summer solstice and St. John\\'s Day at Vigala Sass\\' place on the Isle of Saaremaa. On solstice nights magical incantations were also chanted by the sacrificial stone at Toomemagi Hill in Tartu, where three wooden idols were erected12 (see: Leete 1992). Tõlet used some incantations of fire, stone and wood on its public ceremonies (descriptions see Toomet & Leete 1992 and Toomet & Kaasik 1993). A repertoire of runo songs developed that were sung by the fire or on other gatherings - people preferred songs that created a suitable atmosphere, such as Venna sõjalaul (\\'Brother\\'s Song of War\\'), Pädeva veeretamine (\\'Rolling of the Day\\'), Suur tamm (\\'The Great Oak\\'), Nuttev tamm (\\'The Weeping Oak\\'), etc., all of which acquired a ritual significance. These songs were transmitted within the circle from one person to another, without ever being written down or learned by heart. So a certain common heritage, a stock of songs was created, that everybody knew and that changed little by little. Although the one who introduced a song had learned it from a written source, others learned it from him without any written aids. Certain Heathen greetings developed, as well as preferences for food, beverages, sexual life, clothing and hair style, ways of spending one\\'s spare time and hobbies. E.g. both men and women wear longhair, amulets, fillets, clothes of sheep\\'s wool, home-made clothes, accessories and bags; the members of the grouping declared their closeness to the nature, liberality and pluralism in behaviour, family life, and in educational matters.\\nWe can even speak about the aesthetics characteristic of a certain group of people. So, the feeling of solidarity of the group was created not merely by shared views, beliefs and participation in common undertakings, but also by similarities in the members\\' appearance and in their way of life in general. Both in their appearance and in their behaviour the Heathens have been compared with hippies, in fact, the whole movement has been considered a manifestation of the hippie movement (Ventsel 1996).\\nIn the course of time membership of Tõlet has changed, and so has the prevailing mentality and the concept of Heathenism as such. Originally outward-directed, declarative and outgoing Taara doctrine (or aggressive Heathenism) was later substituted with a more self-absorbed and meditative, pluralist view of Heathenism. Aggressiveness can be considered a manifestation of agony of formation - they had to find a way to drive their existence home to the whole society. Besides, the confusion of the transition period, political and cultural instability, encouraged immoderate declarations. It is the experience of the related nations, the equipoise of the elders and time that have worn down the raw edges.\\nThe Heathenism of the 1980s and 1990s has been nothing uniform of determined; instead, the \"bearers of the religion\" - the holders of the Heathen heritage - have shaped it after their own faces. In fact, Heathenism, \\'the faith of the earth\\', is not a real faith (Leete 1995): to be a Heathen is to be apparently a non-believer (Eller 1990). And yet, it does contain some common traits, which have been aptly formulated by Art Leete:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0* Heathenism is an autonomous contemporary process that emphasises independent being and feeling;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0* Heathenism is an aspiration towards certain knowledge and apprehension through tradition;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0* Heathenism is something distant - a primordial instinct broken out, new evaluation, new order, new morals (Leete 1995).\\nComments\\nThe Heathen identity, as opposed to the German-based national culture, had to stand on a independent foundation, on the early Finno-Ugric tradition, which in essence is purer from foreign influence. This led firstly to the studies of folklore and the kindred nations, to the reassessment of earlier opinions, to attempts to understand and revive the values and knowledge contained in the folk tradition, to synthesise these and adapt these into the contemporary environment and society.\\nPeople sought to synthesise the intuitive Ugric feeling (Leete 1994, 92) that was considered to lay scattered in the depths of the archives as well as in the ways of life and thinking of the kinsfolk living in the vast expanses of Russia. It was in no way a wish to return to the cave, but unlike the academic research work, they tried to familiarise themselves with the world of the tradition, to sense it, to apply or try out what they had learned. This can be seen as the revival of the values contained in the tradition, their converting into the modem language and world. So we can speak about marked interest in folk tradition and folklore in general, and thus the Heathen movement can be viewed as the extremist wing of the folklore movement. Such behaviour is not a mere pose, it permeated one\\'s whole life and mentality. Customary laws, orders, prohibitions, customs became norms for the followers of the movement, which they tried to take as their point of departure in their day-to-day life. Besides, they were united by the conviction that from the ancient heritage they could find the quintessence of the primitive spirit, that would retain the ancient heritage when followed consciously.\\nIn a similar manner they tried to synthesise the Ugric spirit from the experience of the related nations. The idea was that the more and less distant kindred nations in Russia (e.g. the Mari, Mordvinians, Udmurts, Komi, Mansi and Hanti) had retained something (i.e. a certain world outlook or spirit) that Estonians have lost. In this way, living together with the related nations, it is possible to sense and learn the outlook on life and world there, and to adapt it to one\\'s own civilisation. Again, this was no mere imitating, but the cognition experience was applied to synthesise something new. This experience was adapted with the contemporary attitudes and norms. Such an outlook is characteristic of the entire Finno-Ugrian movement13 in Estonia, and so the Heathens can be considered a part of it.\\nNaturally not all who joined the movement were ardent archive-delv-ers or travellers constantly roaming about in the Finno-Ugric territories. It sufficed to be open to this world and to mix with people who were surrounded by a Heathen fluid. Those who had \"found\" or \"recognised\" something could transmit their own experience, create their own tradition which in its turn was observed by others (e.g. Toomet 1989, Eller 1991). And so the Heathen mode of thought spread from person to person. Certain values were intuitively perceived. The ability to synthesise and \"place\" things differed from person to person. Some leaders emerged who had a greater or lesser number of followers. (And certainly there were many independent adherents). The decisive factor was the free will of the participant and his or her self-determination as a Heathen, his or her wish to belong to a vaguely defined group or fraternity. It depended on that particular person which way of being a Heathen suited him or her best. Besides the folkloric and Pan-Finno-Ugrian movement the Heathen community has certain touching points with practitioners of different energy and healing arts, with people interested in Oriental studies and neo-shamanism, with environmentalists, green movement, etc.\\nOne of the Heathen ideals has always been harmonic country life in a homestead, closeness to the nature and environmentalist attitude. (Closeness to the nature is only natural, since the identity is based on folk tradition which mostly stems from peasant environment). The Heathens treasure and preserve such traditional handicraft skills that are falling into oblivion in these days: e.g. making a dug-out, constructing a log house; smithery, pottery, brewing, women\\'s handicraft skills, etc. Many have retained a connection with country life through their background, and the \"right\" Heathens are actually full or half-breed country-people.14 Quite a few of the undertakings of the Heathens have been part of the \\'neighbourhood\\' movement. The opening of the memorial for Anne the witch of KongIa at Viru-Nigula in 1990 and the restoration of the holy grove of Samma in 1989 were organised by Tõlet collaboration with the local heritage protection club, district forest office and kolkhoz (Kongla Anne... 1990, Samma ohvrihiis 1990). Tolet\\'s Spring School in the grove of Samma in 1992 was included in the programme of the World Vironia Days (Kaasik 1993b, 25). In South Estonia the Heathens are connected with the search of the Võru people for their identity.\\nThe Heathen movement can certainly be regarded apart of the search for the national identity of the 1970s and 1980s (see: Kõiva 1995,192). Heathenism is a way to see and feel the world through tradition, to keep in mind one\\'s ancestry and descent, to be alternative, different and independent. It is a possibility to experience communion, to find people with whom you feel good and whom you can rely on in trouble. At the same time it is an ability to get on with one\\'s own hands and wit, a primordial power and will. This is knowledge \"picked up\" from other people, trees, stones, animals, winds, songs, the murmur of waters, the soughing of trees and an infinite number of other sources.\\nSuch movements are by no means exceptional in the culture of other nations. I have had the opportunity to participate (besides the conventions and gatherings organised by Tõlet) in a gathering of the Lithuanian heathens, where there were participants from the Lithuanian Romuva as well as from the corresponding Latvian and Byelorussian heathen groups. Since then I have gathered further information from my correspondence, through e-mail and Internet (e.g. Wiench 1995).\\nThe (neo) heathen movements of the Baltic countries are not very different from each other. Before World War II there were non-Christian religious organisations in all the Baltic countries that established their doctrine on the ancient mythology. In all three countries the Soviet regime persecuted the leaders of these movements (see: Wiench 1995, Tulnola 1989, 9). The succession of the movements survived in exile. The information about the earlier movements was kept and transmitted secretly through the whole period of occupation in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; upon regaining independence the corresponding organisations were formed, which later continued as religious organisations or congregations.\\nWhile the Estonians have found support in the tradition of their Finno-Ugrian kinsfolk and aspired towards the Finno-Ugric and boreal qualities, the Balts and Byelorussians speak about the common Indo-European heritage and roots. Lithuanians who were christianised last and about whose archaic beliefs there is the most information have outlined their pantheon of divinities the most clearly. But other groups are also characterised by appreciation of traditional skills and closeness to the nature.\\nThe movements in the other Baltic states are also closely connected with the folklore movement. In the Soviet republics of the 1970s and 1980s plunging into folklore studies was one of the possibilities to retain one\\'s spiritual independence and identity. The connection with folk tradition plays an important role in the autonomy of the national cultures of the Baltic countries.\\nIn my opinion the connection with folk tradition in Post-Soviet countries differs at present considerably from that of the Western European countries where it seems that national identity is not so clearly connected with the tradition (any more), and the neo-pagan movements are a part of the new-age, green or feminist movement where the distinction between \"one\\'s own\" and \"alien\" plays no part at all. E.g. under the title of neo-paganism following trends and groupings are mentioned: Wicca (in all its many forms), neo-Shamanism, neo-Druidism, Asatru and other forms of Norse neopaganism, neo-Native American practices, the range of things labeled \"Women\\'s Spirituality\", the Sabaean Religious Order, Church of All Worlds, Discordianism, Radical Faeries and other \"Men\\'s Spirituality\" movements, certain people within Thelema and hedonistic Satanism and some of eco-feminism, and last, but not least, Paganism-(with a capital \"P\") strand of neopaganism which strives to allow each person to draw from whatever religious and cultural traditions are meaningful for the individual {FAQ for Alt. Pagan 1994).\\nI do share the opinion of P. Wiench (1995) who has noted, that the emergence of neo-pagan groups in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of communism is not a reflection of Western neo-pagan ideas; for the majority of people interested in neo-paganism the Western neo-pa-ganism is rathern unknown, and pagans in the region are much less interested in magic that the Western pagans. The appellation \"neo-pagan\" used to denote alternative religious groupings in Western countries, does not imply properly the phenomena emerged in Baltics and neighbouring countries, where heathen movements have been closely linked with national \"awakening\" and identity.\\nTranslated by Kai Vassiljeva\\nNotes\\n* I am indebted to Mare Kõiva and Kai Vassiljeva who helped to frame my doubtful ideas in the form of present article.\\n1) In 1932 the devotees of the Taara faith formed the religious association Hiis in Tallinn. In the 1930s Taara faith was gaining ground in the public. By 1940 congregations of Hiis were founded in Tallinn, the province of Võru (Pühajõe Hiis) and Kose; in addition there were 16 committees of native culture in various places all over Estonia, with 700 members all told (the number of supporters of the movement was estimated at 17,000; see Theophilus 1939, 54). At the beginning of the Soviet occupation the legal activities of the Taara followers were banned, the leaders were repressed. The succession of the movement survived in the exile and secretly during the whole occupation period. (For more details, see Arjakas 1987, Deemant 1988, issues of the newsletters Hiis and Videvik.)\\n2) The only base for the name Taara is the Great God of the people of Osilia (the Isle of Saaremaa) T (h) arapita, mentioned in the beginning of 13th century by the Chronicle of Henric of Latvia; it has been interpreted as the battle cry \"Taara avita!\" (\\'Taara help us!\\') (Viires 1990, 1411). Etymologically the word has been traced back to the Scandinavian Thor, but there have also been references to the possible Finno-Ugric origin (cf. Hanti forum). When the pantheon of the ancient Estonian gods was created in the mid-19th century, Taara stood out from among them as the chief god and the god of war. Taara became a beloved figure in the national revival poetry, and later in the prose dealing with the pre-Christian era in the history of Estonia. The popularity of the god Taara was further enhanced by school books of the national revival and independence periods (Viires 1990, 1413-1418).\\nIn their teachings the devotees of Taara use Taara in the highest sense of the concept of deity: Taara is undefined, indefinable, perceivable (Hiie Põhikiri 1931, 68).\\n3) We acknowledge what exists in written form in the Literary Museum - that part of our ancestors\\' beliefs which has survived to our days (Eller 1991, 14). The manifesto of the Heathen fellowship might be K. I. Filer\\'s essay Maarahvast (\\'About the Country People\\'), published in 1970 (see Eller 1990).\\n4) So, when one of the members left, he created a new group called JUUR.\\n5) However, in spring 1995 congregations of the followers of Heathenism and Taara faith were officially registered in Estonia, and simultaneously the heritage protection club Tõlet terminated its activities. (About the aim of congregations see: Kasemets & Barkalaja & Eller 1995.)\\n6) Videvik was published in 1987-1989, 4 issues all in all. The newsletter was distributed as Xerox copies. In 1992 the newsletter was issued in printed form, its circulation was 300 copies. By that time the name of the newsletter was changed to Hiis, because in the meantime pensioner\\'s newspaper Videvik had been started.\\n7) Literary and general cultural movement of Noor-Eesfi (\\'Young Estonia\\') that functioned in the beginning of the 20th century, stressed the importance of the occidentalism in development of Estonian culture: e.g. Let\\'s remain Estonians, yet let\\'s become Europeans!).\\n8) The birth of the earth is determined after the Billingen catastrophe, which has been dated with a year\\'s precision in Sweden, using varved clay (Kymme aastat... 1988, 50). At that time the waters of the late glacial Baltic Glacial Reservoir broke through into the ocean at the spot where today are Lakes of Malar; as a result, the greater part of the territory of Estonia rose above the water. According to this reckoning, the year 1996 would be 10209.\\n9) If there is a difference between the Taara calendar and the runic calendar (Sirvilauad), the latter name is given after a slash. The parallel names offered in the runic calendar are in brackets.\\n10) The following examples have been taken from Videvik No. 1 (1987, 17-18).\\n11) The greater part of the Estonian folk calendar holidays coincide with Catholic festivals and saints\\' days, but the essence of the customs and magic actions is mainly non-Christian.\\n12) The idols were erected near the sacrificial stone in the Toomemägi Park in 1989-1991. They were carved from fallen trees; the biggest of them needed the strength of 10 men to be set up. In March-April 1992 members of the Word of Life congregation, mainly immigrants from the CIS who were studying at Tartu Bible School, took revenge on the idols: the idols were pulled down and destroyed. One night, after several repeated erection and destruction, the idols vanished for good (Leete 1992, 20-21).\\n13) Finno-Ugrian movement can be defined as movement for promoting closer ties among kindred people. In Estonia the movement is led by several societies and foundation \"Fenno-Ugria\".\\n14) The town population of Estonians is mostly descended from the countrymen during the last three generations.\\nReferences\\nAasta... 1990: Aasta 10203 (1990 A.D.).

For an optimal experience visit our site on another browser.\\nComedian Norm Macdonald stirs controversy with comments on #MeToo, Roseanne\\nThe acerbic stand-up said he was happy the #MeToo reckoning seemed to have \"slowed down a little bit.\"\\nLOS ANGELES — Norm Macdonald, the deadpan comedian and former \"Saturday Night Live\" player, stoked controversy on Tuesday after the publication of an interview in which he appeared to deride the #MeToo movement and defend fellow entertainers Louis C.K. and Roseanne Barr.\\nMacdonald, whose new Netflix talk show debuts on Friday, told The Hollywood Reporter that he was happy the #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct seemed to have \"slowed down a little bit,\" lamenting that prominent people accused of wrongdoing were seeing their careers cut short.\\n\"The model used to be: admit wrongdoing, show complete contrition and then we give you a second chance. Now it\\'s admit wrongdoing and you\\'re finished,\" Macdonald told the trade publication, later adding: \"I do think that at some point it will end with a completely innocent person of prominence sticking a gun in his head and ending it.\"\\nAs examples, Macdonald pointed to C.K., who last November admitted to sexual misconduct against five women, and Barr, who was fired from the reboot of her ABC sitcom in May after racist tweets about Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to former President Barack Obama.\\nImage: Norm Macdonald in San Diego\\nNorm Macdonald in San Diego on Sept. 16, 2017.Amy Harris / Invision/AP file\\n\"Roseanne was so broken up [after her show\\'s reboot was canceled] that I got Louis to call her, even though Roseanne was very hard on Louis before that. But she was just so broken and just crying constantly. There are very few people that have gone through what they have, losing everything in a day.\\n\"Of course, people will go, \\'What about the victims?\\' But you know what? The victims didn\\'t have to go through that,\" Macdonald said, adding that C.K. and Barr had said they had a \"good conversation\" and shared advice.\\nIn the hours after the interview was published, those comments were criticized online as flippant and insensitive, with many saying it sounded like Macdonald, known for his wry social commentary, had lost touch with the mood of modern America.\\nMacdonald\\'s scheduled appearance on NBC\\'s \"The Tonight Show\" was canceled in the wake of his comments \"out of sensitivity to our audience,\" a spokesperson for the show said in a statement on Tuesday night.\\nThe appearance was nixed even after the comedian publicly expressed contrition, tweeting that he \"would never defend\" C.K. or Barr and adding that he was \"deeply sorry\" if it \"sounded like I was minimizing the pain that their victims feel to this day.\"\\nMacdonald has ties to both C.K. and Barr. C.K. wrote the forward to Macdonald\\'s semifictionalized memoir, \"Based on a True Story,\" and Barr gave Macdonald one of his first jobs in Hollywood as a writer and story editor on the original run of \"Roseanne.\"\\nIn the interview, Macdonald also appeared to defend Chris Hardwick, the AMC talk show host who was briefly suspended by the cable channel earlier this year after his former girlfriend, Chloe Dykstra, accused him of being emotionally and sexually abusive.\\nMacdonald, for his part, told The Hollywood Reporter that he believes Hardwick \"got the blunt end of the stick there.\" He did not elaborate.\\nHe also weighed in on another hot topic in the comedy world: \"Nanette,\" a recent Netflix stand-up special in which Australian performer Hannah Gadsby dissects the unspoken prejudices of comedy and blasts the way women and queer performers have been marginalized in the entertainment industry.\\nMacdonald said he had \"never seen the \\'Nanette\\' thing because I never wanted to comment on it,\" but he went on to criticize the special as a \"slap in the face of a traditional stand-up comedian who thinks that comedy by dictionary definition is about laughter.\"'},\n",

       "  'text': '#MeToo Anti-Network - slanted #MeToo Anti-Network\\n#MeToo Anti-Network\\nAuthor: kimay\\n#MeToo Anti-Network is a platform that analyzes and looks more closely at the content of tweets under the hashtag #MeToo published on Twitter. The interactive website has an exciting graphic design and provides easy access to this important topic. The website was published on November 22nd, 2021, concerning the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25th.\\nCosmologists say that most of the universe is structured by antimatter. We postulate that social media is similarly structured by effects of the unobserved discourse and experience. The backbone of a movement such as #MeToo is not based on the most-liked and most-retweeted, but by the masses of unobserved tweets. Vast numbers of #MeToo tweets that had no retweets and no likes nonetheless constituted acts of quiet testimony or unassuming solidarity. Conventional measures of network science thus fail to capture the true relevance of #MeToo. As Black feminist Patricia Hill Collins says, “Most activism is brought about by ordinary people like ourselves.”\\nFrom a random selection of one million #MeToo tweets, they read through all examples with more than 100 retweets. Only eight out of the 894 tweets are actual tweets about sexual assault or experiences around the topic of #MeToo. Of the rest, the vast majority are news media posts and political (trolling) discussions, most of them neglecting the specific issues and survivor voices at the heart of the MeToo movement.\\nFrom a distance, the graphics appear as abstract diagrams, similar to Bridget Riley’s work. Each line contains a powerful request for a reordering of power within society. They present an opportunity to engage with each request—from individual people at individual moments within a collective movement that is not over. #MeToo is urgent, #InvisibleNoMore is urgent, #BelieveBlackWomen is urgent, #MMIWG2S is urgent, #SayHerName is urgent. We are still living in a crisis of sexual violence. So you are invited to ditch the networked metrics and listen.\\n#MeToo Anti-Network is a project by Kim Albrecht with textual and conceptual support from Catherine D’Ignazio, Cole Martin, and Matthew Battles.

       "  'text': \"Julia Garner on 'The Assistant,' the #MeToo Film Hollywood Needs | Marie Claire Julia Garner Stars in 'The Assistant,' the #MeToo Film Hollywood Needs\\nThe Ozark actress talks about the challenging role—and why such a story is so important to share on-screen.\\nLip, Technology, Electronic device,\\n(Image credit: Ty Johnson / Bleecker Street)\\nThe Assistant,\\xa0in theaters January 31is one of those films that sneaks inside you, uninvited, and lingers there like a disease that hasn't yet been diagnosed. It’s also a movie that's deeply necessary, particularly for Hollywood, baring not only the sexual abuse that runs rampant in the industry, but also the emotional abuse that plagues its entry level employees.\\nEmmy-nominated Julia Garner (you know her from\\xa0Ozark) stars as Jane, a young overworked and mistreated assistant to a big-time film producer. Though her media-mogul boss remains unseen (you see his looming silhouette though a door pane or hear him snarl at Jane on the phone) the clues—insulin syringes in in the trashcan, hotel room meetings—suggest that the faceless exec could be Harvey Weinstein.\\nBut, at its core,\\xa0The Assistant\\xa0isn’t about one abusive man wielding his power recklessly and unchecked. He remains faceless because he could be any man with power in any industry. It’s a more macro examination of what keeps said man in power, and the people complicit. “I didn’t want it to be just about sexual assault,” Garner tells\\xa0Marie Claire. “I wanted it to express that everybody—even the ones who aren’t getting sexually abused—is a victim in a way. It’s a whole system.”\\nIndirect complicity feels evident on every level of the food chain in the film: The executive who waits in the black sedan for his boss while he finishes a “meeting” with an aspiring actress; the junior male producer who laughs along at crude jokes, and finally Jane—the lowest on the totem pole, the person we ache for—the immobilized subordinate who has to make the hotel room reservation or lose her job. Like many character’s in the film, she falls somewhat complicatedly in that area between victim and victimizer, and Garner skillfully wears her character’s petrified confliction on her face.\\nIn a particularly brutal scene, Jane approaches a man in Human Resources to report her boss’s bad behavior, which he responds to with not-so-veiled threats to her career and gaslighting to make her reconsider what she knows. After her failed attempt, Jane sludges on through her day (the entire film takes place over the course of a single day) clearing dirty dishes from conference rooms and discarding syringes into biohazard bags, an empty shell of a person with few options. You empathize fiercely with her. But you can’t forget about the girl in the hotel room. The film begs the question, can we decide who is guilty, and who is another victim? It’s not something any piece of pop culture can easily answer, but it’s something for all of us to consider.\\nAt least one person wants to protect Jane: Garner. “People are quick to judge Jane,” she says, “but realistically, with such a traumatic experience, you don’t really know it’s happening. You don’t really see how bad it is because it’s so shocking that you don’t really know what to say or how to react. Jane is just so powerless.”\\nLuxury vehicle, Sitting, Passenger, Car, Vehicle, Fictional character, Family car,\\nJulia Garner (left) stars as Jane and Kristine Froseth (right) stars as Sienna, the girl Jane has to leave at a hotel with her boss.\\n(Image credit: Courtesy of Bleecker Street)\\nJane has very few lines throughout the film (most definitely a metaphor for her silenced voice); most of the movie plays out on Garner’s face. To embody her character, Garner first studied her own manager’s assistant, taking on her mannerisms. Then, she met a former assistant at a production agency who was physically and verbally berated with the objective of learning what it feels like to be treated as less-than. But to create a persona that had to handle sexual abuse, she had to dig deeper—and she had the unfortunate true stories of abuse in Hollywood to guide her. “I’ve been very lucky that I’ve never been sexually assaulted or abused, verbally, physically,” she says. Entering the headspace was trying on her. The film was shot over 18 days, and during that time it was hard to shake Jane after hours. “[I kept thinking,]\\xa0Why do I feel so alone?\\xa0And it’s because Jane was very alone,” she says. “I can’t tell you how much I manipulate my mind, my headspace,” she says. “It’s not the healthiest thing, but I want to get a good performance.”\\nHer performance was good, very good, in a crushing kind of way: Raw and excruciatingly hard to watch. But it is a must-watch—if not to learn how the system keeps bad people in power, than to witness how the ripple effects are felt by everyone in it's wake.\\nSpoilers ahead: If you want a happy, “we got him\\xa0ending, you’ll be disappointed. Much like most real cases of gross injustice, the movie doesn’t wrap with a satisfying arrest scene, or even a comforting moment for Jane that gives us hope for her future. You leave the theater emotionally exhausted, slightly nauseous, and most importantly, agonizingly aware. For Garner, that’s exactly the point.\\n“This film is a reminder that people are human. I want everyone to see it—not because I’m in it—but because it’s such an important film. It’s a reminder to keep everybody in check.”\\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the\\xa0Marie Claire newsletter.\\nsubscribe here\\nMegan DiTrolio\\nMegan DiTrolio is the editor of features and special projects at Marie Claire, where she oversees all career coverage and writes and edits stories on women’s issues, politics, cultural trends, and more.

       "  'text': 'The #MeToo conundrum | Canadian Lawyer The #MeToo conundrum\\nA recent article in The Hollywood Reporter caught my eye. The headline announced: “The New #MeToo Economy: Hollywood Lawyers, Crisis PR Pros Seeing ‘Unprecedented’ Uptick in Business.”\\nThe #MeToo conundrum\\nIllustration: Wayne Mills\\nPhilip Slayton\\nLawyers need to keep their ethical duties in mind with sexual harassment claims.\\nA recent article in The Hollywood Reporter caught my eye. The headline announced: “The New #MeToo Economy: Hollywood Lawyers, Crisis PR Pros Seeing ‘Unprecedented’ Uptick in Business.”\\nAin’t capitalism wonderful? No matter what happens, there’s always a buck to be made. Step right up for new billable-hour opportunities presented by the #MeToo economy.\\nBut maybe we lawyers should tread carefully on this one. Trouble lurks in the weeds. One lawyer specializing in sexual harassment claims told The Hollywood Reporter, “It’s easily a 300-per-cent [increase] . . .\\nThis is unprecedented in volume and duration.” But she cautioned about complaints “where the person is just trying to get on the sexual harassment bandwagon.” Another lawyer interviewed by the newspaper noted that there are many cases where purported victims propose backdoor deals in exchange for silence. He said, “I am aware of many lawyers . . . who have received secret demand letters with disguised threats to make an allegation public unless there is a quick settlement.” The disguised threat letter seems just to be a new version of the old practice, familiar to many long-in-the-tooth lawyers, of paying those who allege sexual harassment to keep quiet about it.\\nThe #MeToo movement is steamrolling across the western world. Like it or not, lawyers are caught up in this profound cultural and social issue. It presents them with ethical conundrums, some familiar, some new. First of all, there may be a problem with the plaintiff. Suppose you are asked to represent a purported victim of sexual harassment who wants to go public — issue statements, call press conferences, initiate civil litigation. But you are skeptical of your client’s story or doubt their bona fides or suspect this is just a self-serving attempt to climb on the sexual harassment bandwagon. What’s the right thing to do? The mere whiff of an allegation or hint of a rumour, jet-propelled by social media, can damage or destroy lives and careers in a trice and — as collateral damage — threaten the existence of important institutions (businesses, political parties, theatre companies). Do you want to be part of that? Suppose your client, more interested in money than publicity, asks you to send one of those backdoor disguised threat demand letters. Isn’t that a bit unsavoury? Doesn’t it smack a little of extortion?\\nThe plaintiff problem in sexual harassment cases is a new expression of an old quandary. Should lawyers evaluate their clients’ motives or the broader social consequences of proceeding with litigation and temper their advice with those considerations in mind? Almost every lawyer, I think, would answer in the negative, even if they found their client’s intentions reprehensible and conduct odious. Most lawyers believe that everyone is entitled to vigorous legal representation within the boundaries of the law. Our system, they will tell you, depends upon it. There is another way of looking at things. Ten years ago, I got into trouble in these pages when I wrote: “a lawyer, as a well-educated creature of his community, should take into account the values and well-being of that community when he does his work.” I had in mind lawyers who shared some responsibility for the 2007/8 financial meltdown. That column garnered a lot of criticism. One distinguished lawyer wrote, “I wonder if your view of lawyer morality would be the same if you needed to retain a lawyer.” (A low blow, I thought.) Another correspondent ranted on about “single issue fanatics.”\\nI didn’t think it was so radical to suggest, as many bar association rules of conduct state, that a lawyer “should not knowingly assist or permit the client to do anything that the lawyer considers to be dishonest or dishonourable.” I still don’t. Vigorous representation, yes, but, sometimes, vigorous representation can go a step too far. Readers will remember that, as a by-product of the Jian Ghomeshi affair, some argued that a lawyer defending a person accused of sexual assault had social obligations that mitigated their responsibility to the accused, obligations that included not embracing myths and stereotypes about women and sex.\\nThen there’s the flip side, the dilemma of the defendant. What advice do you give to someone who is accused of sexual harassment, particularly if the accusation seems weak? Should they fight back, all guns blazing, sue for wrongful dismissal and defamation and whatever else, try to cow their accuser and rescue their reputation? Or is it better, as social media does its gruesome hatchet job, to recognize the apparent hopelessness of the situation, no matter what the facts are, to accept defeat and slink away in silence, as so many of those who are accused seem to do even if the allegations don’t seem particularly credible? Does it matter whether you, the lawyer, thinks the accusations about your client are overblown or false?\\nI don’t understand why most of those recently accused of sexual harassment haven’t fought back. Maybe it’s because they are completely compromised (particularly when there are multiple accusers) and fighting back seems futile. Better to move to Patagonia and start a new life. Maybe it’s because they can’t afford to hire a lawyer (although some lawyers may take these cases on a contingency basis). Maybe it’s just because they have no stomach for a public fight, which could keep the story alive and further damage their reputation. Savvy libel lawyers often advise that the game isn’t worth the candle.\\nIt’s difficult to know what to do, but here’s what I think. Don’t represent someone who wants to go public with highly dubious claims of sexual harassment that will destroy lives and careers. Don’t engage in backdoor threats of publicity designed to extort money. Do put the accused to the test by urging a vigorous defence and counterattack — that’s if they truly consider the accusations about them to be false.\\nPhilip Slayton’s latest book, How To Be Good: The Struggle Between Law and Ethics, was published in October.'},\n",

In 2022, it expanded to offer support and resources to those who have experienced any kind of discrimination, harassment or abuse while working in the industry. In July of 2023, WIF began offering resources and support for strike-affected workers through the helpline.\\n“When we started the helpline in 2017, it was clear that the industry needed this resource and no one else was doing it,” WIF CEO Kirsten Schaffer said Thursday. “After nearly seven years and an expanded mandate, the time is right to pass the baton. The Hollywood Commission — with its broad base of support from the industry’s biggest companies — is the right home for a helpline that is open to all workers who experience bullying, harassment, discrimination or abuse.”\\nThe transfer of the helpline comes shortly after the Hollywood Commission’s launch of MyConnext, an online resource that can assist entertainment workers with reporting harassment and share information on various options in doing so.\\n“The Entertainment Industry Helpline is a critical part of our ecosystem, filling a gap for some of the industry’s most vulnerable workers,” said Malia Arrington, executive director of the Hollywood Commission. “It is a vitally important independent voice, providing guidance to all industry workers on a range of questions, from understanding options to finding the right support.”\\nThe post Women In Film Transfers Entertainment Industry Helpline to Hollywood Commission appeared first on TheWrap.'},\n",

For the ambitious beginner, the \"Touch\" version offers standard-sized keys with touch response. The 61-key keyboard features clean lines and a deliberately restrained appearance, consciously avoiding flashy colorful elements and playful details. At the same time, the \"Edition\" technically offers everything a budget-conscious musician can expect from a beginner keyboard.\\nSound Variety and Diversity\\nWith 300 sounds and rhythms each, your taste in preferred musical styles will never be neglected. From acoustic piano to distorted guitar, string ensembles, tenor saxophone, and many other instruments, plus soul, dance, shuffle, and samba rhythms (and more!), the FunKey Edition provides a wide range of musical possibilities. Additionally, you can use effects like sustain and vibrato, play with two selected sounds simultaneously via \"Dual Voice,\" or add special effects to your playing through fill-ins.\\nTouch Response\\n\"Touch Response\" or \"touch sensitivity\" refers to the function where harder played notes sound louder. Just like an acoustic piano, this adds more dynamics and expression to your playing. Conveniently, this function can be turned on and off with a single button press.\\nYou Decide When and Where!\\nIf you want to play keyboard at home without disturbing your family or neighbors, simply plug your headphones into the FunKey. An automatic function simultaneously disables the keyboard’s speakers, so you can practice without any guilt. Since the FunKey is portable and allows both mains and battery operation, you can easily take it to other retreat locations.\\nStable Z-Stand with Screw Lock\\nThis classic Z-stand with screw lock not only provides a firm and secure base for your keyboard but also an additional safety feature in the form of a screw fastener. Your instrument, with the appropriate threaded inserts, is simply screwed to the stand, giving you stable and robust support. With just a few simple steps, the McGrey stand can be quickly and easily assembled. The included instructions will guide you through the process.

       "  'text': 'Symptoms & Causes of Gastritis & Gastropathy - NIDDK Symptoms & Causes of Gastritis & Gastropathy\\nWhat are the symptoms of gastritis and gastropathy?\\nThe majority of people with gastritis or gastropathy don’t have any symptoms.\\nIn some cases, gastritis and gastropathy cause symptoms of indigestion, also called dyspepsia. Symptoms may include\\npain or discomfort in the upper abdomen\\nnausea or vomiting\\nfeeling full too soon during a meal\\nfeeling too full after a meal\\nloss of appetite\\nweight loss\\nIf gastritis or gastropathy leads to erosions or ulcers, the stomach lining may bleed. If you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach, seek medical help right away. Symptoms of bleeding in your stomach may include\\nblack or tarry stool or red or maroon blood mixed with your stool\\ncramps, discomfort, or pain in your abdomen\\nfeeling tired, short of breath, or light-headed\\nred blood in vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds\\nIf you have mild bleeding in your stomach, you may have a small amount of blood in your stool and not notice it. This is called occult bleeding.\\nWhat causes gastritis and gastropathy?\\nDifferent types of gastritis and gastropathy\\xa0have different causes.\\nCommon causes of gastritis and gastropathy\\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis. Infection with H. pylori bacteria causes H. pylori gastritis. Researchers are still studying how people become infected. H. pylori bacteria may spread from person to person through contact with an infected person’s vomit, stool, or saliva. Food or water contaminated with an infected person’s vomit, stool, or saliva may also spread the bacteria from person to person.\\nReactive gastropathy. Reactive gastropathy is caused by long-term contact with substances that irritate the stomach lining, most often nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, and bile reflux, which is backward flow of bile from the small intestine to the stomach. Surgery that removes part of the stomach—such as some types of weight-loss surgery, also called metabolic and bariatric surgery—is the most common cause of bile reflux.\\nClear cup of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) spilling out onto table.\\nLong-term use of NSAIDs may cause reactive gastropathy.\\nAutoimmune gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system\\xa0attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining.\\nAcute erosive gastropathy. Serious health problems—such as severe injuries or burns, critical illness, or sepsis—can reduce the blood flow to the stomach lining, causing a form of acute erosive gastropathy called stress gastritis.\\nContact with substances that irritate the stomach lining—including NSAIDs, alcohol, and cocaine—can also cause acute erosive gastropathy.\\nOther causes of gastritis and gastropathy\\nLess common causes of gastritis and gastropathy include\\nLast Reviewed August 2019\\nAn official form of the United States government.

       "  'text': \"The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2025 The best ergonomic keyboards reduce strain on your hands, wrists, and arms. They help lower the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) by letting you type in a more natural position, thanks to features like split layouts, curved designs, and palm rests.\\nWhat to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard in 2025\\nErgonomic keyboards perform the same function as regular keyboards but with added support to reduce strain on your wrists, hands, and fingers. These keyboards are designed to keep your hands and wrists in a more natural position, helping to minimize muscle strain and prevent potential injuries from prolonged typing.\\nThere’s a wide variety of ergonomic keyboards on the market, so it’s important to think about what features matter most to you before making a purchase. From layout to design, each type offers unique benefits, depending on your preferences and needs.\\nMost ergonomic keyboards fall into two main categories. The first type is the split-design keyboard, which, as the name suggests, separates the key layout into two sections for more natural wrist positioning. Split-design keyboards can come in two forms: fully detachable halves that let you adjust each side independently or a single-unit keyboard with a split key layout but fixed structure.\\nThe second category is the concave design, where the keyboard has a curved, sloped keyboard frame. This design reduces finger movement and strain while maintaining a more familiar layout, making it a great option for those who don’t prefer split keyboards.\\nMany ergonomic keyboards also feature additional design elements to improve comfort and reduce strain. Thumb clusters, for example, group high-use keys like Enter, Space, and Control closer to your natural hand position, minimizing unnecessary movement.\\nWhen choosing an ergonomic keyboard, you’ll also want to think about connectivity. Would you prefer the flexibility of a wireless Bluetooth connection, or are you comfortable with a wired option for reliable performance? Some keyboards are specifically built for Windows, while others offer full compatibility with both Windows and Mac devices.\\nOur list includes several great options, whether for wireless connectivity, a versatile keyboard and mouse combo, or a compact design that fits your typing style and ergonomic needs.\\nHow Did We Research\\nModels Evaluated\\nHours Researched\\nReviews Analyzed\\n12\\n16\\n18\\nHow-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times. We only recommend the best products based on our research and expertise. We never accept payment to endorse or review a product.

We hear about a new contraceptive law in Massachusetts and have a different look at the #MeToo social media campaign. I’m Allison Dunne and this is 51%.\\nResearch has long shown that women who enter college intending to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering or math abandon that path more frequently than their male peers. And now a new study out of Stanford University and the University of Minnesota has found a possible source of that gender gap - high-stakes exams at the college level can actually put female students at a disadvantage. The study’s findings suggest that women are more heavily influenced than men by test anxiety, and are more often \"weeded\" out in large \"gateway\" classes early on in their education. 51%\\'s Jessica Bloustein Marshall spoke with one of the study\\'s co-authors, University of Minnesota Postdoctoral Associate Cissy Ballen about the study, and about how reducing test anxiety could help close a pervasive gender gap in STEM.\\nThat was University of Minnesota Postdoctoral Associate Cissy Ballen speaking with 51%\\'s Jessica Bloustein Marshall.\\nRepublican Governor Charlie Baker signed a bill in November ensuring no-cost contraceptives in Massachusetts – regardless of health care law on the federal level. 51%’s JD Allen spoke with state Representative Tricia Farley-Bouvier, a Pittsfield Democrat, about the law.\\nThat was state representative Tricia Farley-Bouvier, a Democrat from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, speaking with 51%’s JD Allen.\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, killed more than 33,000 people in 2015, more than any year on record.

Since, the accusations have spread from Hollywood to the political realm. The idea behind #MeToo is to encourage sexual assault survivors and sexual harassment victims to post the hashtag to raise awareness.

       "  'text': 'The Das Keyboard 4 Professional Mechanical Keyboard - The Das Keyboard \\'Prime 13\\' & \\'4 Professional\\' Mechanical Keyboard Review The Das Keyboard 4 Professional Mechanical Keyboard\\nThe Das Keyboard 4 Professional is a postmodern design, with the company trying to balance\\xa0between a minimalistic and a futuristic appearance. The asymmetric body consists of an aluminum top cover and a plastic lower frame, with the company logo printed at the top right corner of the keyboard. Note that the top aluminum frame is for aesthetics only and not for mechanical cohesion, as the keyboard\\'s keys and PCB are internally supported by a steel plate.\\nWe received the US layout version of the Das Keyboard 4 Professional. It is a standard 104-key\\xa0keyboard that fully adheres to the ANSI layout, with a normal bottom row. The bottom row of the keyboard has a 6.25× Spacebar and seven 1.25× bottom row keys. Virtually the only slight exception is that the company printed their own logo on the \"Windows\" keys instead of Microsoft\\'s.\\nThe keycap characters of the Das Keyboard 4 Professional are laser etched. Laser etching is a common feature among keyboards with price tags this high, yet we should note that there can be great quality differences between different manufacturers. With this process, the etching removes part of the paint on the keycap to reveal the unpainted plastic underneath; therefore\\xa0the character cannot fade because the character itself actually is the only part of the keycap that is not painted. The paint of the keycap however can fade, meaning that the keycap will eventually start becoming smoother and blurry. In such cases, it all comes down on the quality of the keycap and its painting. Unfortunately, we cannot comment on the long term reliability of the process as it would take at least several weeks of testing. The relatively small characters on the keycaps of the Das Keyboard 4 Professional are very sharp.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are no macro keys on the Das Keyboard 4 Professional and the keyboard has no reprogramming/layout changing capabilities - at least not without with assistance from third party software. At the top right corner of the keyboard we can see a large volume wheel and five low-profile buttons. Three of the buttons are for basic media controls, the round button is for muting the sound volume and the square button is, by default, sending a sleep command to the PC. This can be very handy for quickly putting a PC to sleep/lock and then waking it up from the keyboard without having to reach for the tower, especially in office/working environments where people cannot just leave their posts with their PCs on. The volume wheel is immaculately integrated onto the keyboard and has a satisfactorily clicky feeling when used.\\nThe designer placed two USB 3.0 ports at the rear top right corner of the keyboard. Note that we rarely see USB 3.0 hubs on keyboards, even on some of the most expensive models out there. The Das Keyboard 4 Professional has only one thick cable that ends up to a single USB 3.0 connector. If the keyboard is connected to a USB 3.0 or 3.1 port, the port should provide enough power for the keyboard and its two USB 3.0 ports. If however it is connected to a USB 2.0/1.1 port, the hub might not operate properly.\\nBeneath the keycaps we find original Cherry MX switches. Our sample came with Brown switches but there is also a version with Blue switches for those that prefer to have a strong audible feedback. The strange part is that we found Costar-type bar stabilizers beneath the larger keys rather than the usual cross-type stabilizers we usually find on Cherry-based motherboards. There is very little difference on the actual feeling of the key when comparing the two stabilization methods, but keycaps with costar-type stabilizers tend to wiggle a little more and can be a pain to remove. Combined with the fact that the company does not provide a keycap puller, the designer really did not mean for the user to be removing the keycaps on this model.\\nRemoving the core of the Das Keyboard 4 Professional from its exterior frame reveals that the keyboard is built on two PCBs. The main PCB features only the keys and is attached to a steel plate that provides the usual excellent mechanical strength that most mechanical keyboards have, while the second PCB is home for the extra buttons, the USB hub and the ICs.\\nA Nuvoton NUC123SD4AN0 microcontroller is the heart of the Das Keyboard 4 Professional. Its Cortex-M0 core runs up to 72 MHz and has 68 KB of flash memory. Although it would not be out of the ordinary on a fully-featured gaming keyboard, this microcontroller is a major overkill on a model that has no backlighting and lacks any programmability features. A VIA VL812-Q7 controller handles the USB 3.0 ports.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nIntroduction, Packaging & Bundle The Das Keyboard Prime 13 Mechanical Keyboard\\nComments Locked\\n58 Comments\\nView All Comments\\nWorldWithoutMadness - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nPlease do a review about Topre realforce RGB!\\nKrause - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nI don\\'t think any of these tech sites review the actual high end mechanical keyboards, i\\'ve never seen a site like this with a keyboard review/mechanical best of list that actually contained a single keyboard that should be there.\\nFlunk - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nThey review what the manufacturers send them.\\ntachi1247 - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nThey also can make requests to mfr\\'s for reviews. While smaller sites and individuals will be sent things by manufacturers for reviews to help spread the word about the new product, a site like Anandtech has the industry clout to approach a manufacturer and request a sample for an upcoming article.\\nHolliday75 - Saturday, January 14, 2017 - link\\nI wonder if Anandtech could....persuade people to turn over samples for testing. Say publish an ever expanding db of devices they requested and either a link to the article or a refusal by the manufacturer to send one. Naturally people will ask why, what are they hiding and could look bad on them.\\nJCB994 - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nWhat are the high end mechanical keyboards?\\nJoeyJoJo123 - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nThe same ones as the low end mechanical keyboards. The difference between Kailh or authentic Cherry MX isn\\'t as noticeable as the difference between $5 rubber dome office keyboard and an average $70 mechanical keyboard.\\nAny further differentiation is pretty absurd and ultimately comes down to brand preference or possibly elitism. The entire point is that mechanical key switches have a MTBF of millions of keystrokes, which is several orders more reliable than rubber dome key switches.\\nFallen Kell - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nThe difference between a good mechanical keyboard and a crappy one is the same reasoning why rubber dome key switches were invented in the first place, cost cutting. The difference of type of plastic used in a part can be the difference of lasting for 10\\'s of years without reacting to sunlight and oils/grease/dirt from people\\'s hands/fingers or just making it long enough to exceed the keyboard\\'s product warranty. It is the difference between using double-shot keycaps vs \"painted and laser etched\". A double-shot keycap will never wear out the character on the key from normal use, but laser etched keycaps will wear at some point as the paint does not last forever (unlike physical plastic which will last hundreds of years). The support braces used are another huge area of cost cutting which ultimately affects how well the keyboard survives. And then there is the matter of the switches being properly secured and supported into the PCB (a quick way to cut costs is to skimp on that physical connection, leading to solder points cracking over use as they take the load of the fingers hitting the key).\\nJetpil0t01 - Sunday, January 15, 2017 - link\\nI have a Razer Blackwidow Tournament Stealth 2014 and a Das Keyboard 4C Pro TKL and the difference is entirely down to build quality. I actually prefer the typing experience on the Razer, but you can clearly tell the quality of the build of the Das is much better. That being said, I have never had any keyboard in the last 20 years break due to poor build quality of the case, keys, cable or anything else, so its arguable the build quality doesn\\'t add up to much in real terms. I have had the WASD keys on an expensive membrane board get mushy after 5 years of use, but that\\'s still 5 years of use for under $100 which again to me seems trivial as far as the expense of replacing it.\\nI can understand exactly why you would buy the Das Pro model featured here, the USB 3.0 and media controls as well as the clean but sharp aesthetic work perfectly in the office. If you are using it for productivity, the price also becomes trivial, so being higher quality makes sense. Plus there is little to no chance people will be dropping a Corsair RGB into the office without looking like a complete tool, so this seems to hit the target market perfectly.\\nIn the home however, the prime board starts to make little to no sense, outside of brand appeal. If it still had the USB and/or media controls the price might work, but where it is now, there are simply more feature rich products for less money, so it\\'s going to have a tough time selling on build quality alone.\\nAll they needed to do here IMO was take the previous model, drop PBT caps on it, upgrade the hub to USB 3 and keep that in both models and you would have a compelling product. As it is, I would have a hard time recommending this over a Deck or Ducky board for professional or home use and I have had two Das boards previously.\\nKrause - Tuesday, January 10, 2017 - link\\nThe difference comes down to build quality and keycap material. Any POS that uses clear ABS (garbage plastic) keycaps that are then painted a dark color except for the legend to create cheap backlighting instead of doing true double shots should automatically be given 1 star out of pure principle.\\nOn a positive note though, painting (or \"coating\" in a rubberized spray paint if they try to spin it as a feature) completely negates the importance of using better plastics as the cap material in the first place so it really didn\\'t matter if they used cheap ABS or PBT.\\nLog in\\nDon\\'t have an account?

       "  'text': 'How Lashana Lynch and Ana de Armas Are Helping Modernize James Bond Skip to main content\\nGot a tip?\\nNewsletters\\nBond Women: How Rising Stars Lashana Lynch and Ana de Armas Are Helping Modernize 007\\nThe \\'No Time to Die\\' actresses, part of The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Next Gen Talent list, open up about bringing James Bond into the #MeToo age: \"There is an evolution.\"\\nWhen Ana de Armas first arrived at London’s Pinewood Studios to shoot No Time to Die, the 25th installment in the James Bond franchise, she was a bit starstruck — though not when introduced to lead Daniel Craig. It happened as she was walking into a meeting with director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who was chatting with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the British creator of Fleabag and Killing Eve who’d been hired to bring a fresh female perspective (and some humor) to the film’s script.\\n“I saw Phoebe, and I just blushed — I got red like a tomato,” says de Armas, 31. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, can I hug you? I want to be your friend.’ ” De Armas’ co-star, Lashana Lynch, had a similar reaction when she learned of Waller-Bridge’s involvement. “I very literally squealed when I first heard her name,” says Lynch, 31. “I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, British girl just like me. She’s going to know how to actually take care of women onscreen.’ “\\nNever has that been so critical for a Bond film. When it’s released April 10, the $250 million No Time to Die will be the first entry in the series to land in a #MeToo and Time’s Up world. And while the $7 billion franchise may forever be best known for its womanizing namesake agent, director Fukunaga (True Detective, Beasts of No Nation) and producer Barbara Broccoli have worked hard with both Lynch and de Armas to create a new type of female Bond character who is much more fully realized than the “Bond girls” of films past.\\n“It’s pretty obvious that there is an evolution in the fact that Lashana is one of the main characters in the film and wears the pants — literally. I wear the gown. She wears the pants,” says de Armas, curled up in a chair in the lobby of London’s Charlotte Street Hotel.\\nShe and Lynch, chatting about their career trajectories for THR‘s annual Next Gen issue, are both in the midst of breakout years. In addition to Bond, de Armas plays a lead in Rian Johnson’s Knives Out (Nov. 27) and will portray Marilyn Monroe in Netflix’s Blonde, arriving in 2020. Lynch co-starred in March’s blockbuster Captain Marvel and will soon begin shooting FX’s anticipated comic book adaptation of Y: The Last Man.\\nNow they are one week away from wrapping what has been an epic six-month Bond shoot, and both are exhausted. De Armas pours two packets of sugar into her coffee. “I use a lot of sugar,” says the Cuban-Spanish actress apologetically as she cracks open still another packet. “I usually put condensed milk in it — we call it café bon bon.”\\nLynch, who plays a British agent in the film, is presently at her West London home sleeping after shooting late into the night, but during an interview at the Ace Hotel the next day, her voice cracks from strain and she orders a hot tea. “Luckily, we don’t have any speaking scenes next week, so I don’t have to use it,” she says.\\nThese two rising stars don’t have much in common when it comes their paths to Bond. One was born in Cuba. The other in London to Jamaican parents. One cut her teeth on Spanish TV, the other on the stage. But both have roots tied to this latest Bond outing, which is set in Cuba and Jamaica. And through their characters, they’re helping redefine what it means to be a Bond heroine. “Everyone was really responsive to having her be what I wanted,” says Lynch. “You’re given a fresh perspective on a brand-new black woman in the Bond world.”\\nBond girls have a complicated history. For decades, they’ve had a reputation for being eye candy, wooed by Bond and then cast off. In 1964’s Goldfinger, Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) says repeatedly she’s not interested, but Bond tosses her to the ground and kisses her; in From Russia With Love (1963), Bond attempts to beat a confession out of Tatiana Romanova (Daniela Bianchi); and in 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever, Bond pulls a bikini top off Marie (Denise Perrier) and strangles her with it. Recent films have brought more fully realized female characters into the series, including Judi Dench’s M, Naomie Harris’ Moneypenny and Léa Seydoux’s Madeleine Swann, the latter two of whom return in No Time to Die. Still, both de Armas and Lynch paused before signing on.\\n“[The women] have been sexualized before, a stereotype, a kind of woman who will always be in danger and waiting to be rescued by Bond,” says de Armas.\\nDe Armas notes that she has worked hard to avoid being typecast. After attending Cuba’s National Theater School, she moved to Spain when she 18. “Literally two weeks after I moved, I was cast as one of the lead actors in a new TV show that became like the most successful TV show for the next three years,” she says of booking El Internado, a drama set at a boarding school. But after a few years in Madrid, she found herself outgrowing it — she was 22 playing 16. She moved to Los Angeles, where her Hands of Stone co-star Édgar Ramírez introduced her to his agent.\\nThe problem was, she didn’t speak English. She found herself at CAA, sitting with “a full team that I really couldn’t communicate with,” she says. She even booked a major horror film, Knock Knock with Keanu Reeves, without speaking the language. “I learned it phonetically,” she says. “I wasn’t really sure what I was saying.” She quickly enrolled in English classes and, as soon as she could say a few words, called her team with a mandate — she didn’t want to go out for Latin-specific roles: “I said, ‘I don’t want to audition for Maria, Juana and Lola and all these things. I want to audition for the same parts that everybody is auditioning for.’ “\\nShe booked War Dogs with Miles Teller and Jonah Hill and Overdrive with Scott Eastwood. A role in 2017’s Blade Runner 2049 as Ryan Gosling’s love interest was supposed to be her breakout, but the film underperformed. “I think I was home literally doing nothing for a year,” she says. The paycheck did allow her to buy her first big splurge, a house in Cuba, which she still visits regularly.\\nWhen her agents told her about a role in Knives Out, Johnson’s comedic mystery ensemble, she was put off by the “pretty Latina caretaker” logline and passed on even auditioning. “I’m like, ‘Latina again, really? No! I am not doing this.’ ” She only agreed to go in when they sent her the script and she realized the part was the heart of the film, a kind caregiver with secrets of her own who is swept up in the family drama. “She’s obviously got tremendous skills as an actor,” says Johnson, who cast her, “but those eyes, man, you just look at those eyes and instantly you’re on her side.” (The film features her Bond co-star Craig as well as Toni Collette, Chris Evans and Michael Shannon.)\\nIt was Bond producer Broccoli, who has overseen the franchise with her half brother Michael G. Wilson since 1995, who first thought of de Armas for No Time to Die. The two had met five years earlier, when de Armas, still new to L.A., was brought to Soho House by Knock Knock producer Colleen Camp. She introduced the actress to Broccoli, who was there with Spectre helmer Sam Mendes. “We met very briefly because I couldn’t say anything [in English],” says de Armas. “But I guess Barbara never forgot that meeting.” When de Armas had wrapped Knives Out, she says she got a call from Fukunaga, who told her that part of the Bond film is set in Cuba and “he wanted to write something for me.”\\nBroccoli, who also was key in bringing Lynch on board, has been vocal about the franchise’s need to evolve. “#MeToo has influenced our culture, which is a great thing, so of course it’s going to influence everything we do on Bond,” she told the Daily Mail in April. “The films are representative of the times they’re in.”\\nAfter producing a 2018 London play in which Lynch starred, Broccoli reached out to the actress for the role of Nomi (Lupita Nyong’o previously had been eyed, but a deal was never made, according to sources). “I trusted Barbara from the beginning,” says Lynch. “I think the franchise has changed so much over the years — with the past five movies, I’ve witnessed the change.”\\nLynch, who is of Jamaican descent, was born and raised in London, and describes herself as a “London girl through and through.” She attended ArtsEd drama school then jumped into theater work, doing odd jobs to make ends meet (retail, a car service). “There was never a plan B, from 5 years old to now, there’s never been one,” she says. After her feature debut, the 2013 British film Fast Girls, she starred in the short-lived 2017 ABC series Still Star-Crossed, produced by Shonda Rhimes, and signed with ICM.\\nHer big break came when she landed the part of Maria Rambeau, a former Air Force pilot and a single mother, in Captain Marvel, which earned $1.1 billion worldwide. “Getting into the Marvel universe was something that I’d been aiming for for two to three years,” says Lynch, who had sent tapes in for Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming.\\nCaptain Marvel\\n“It’s her empathy,” says Captain Marvel star Brie Larson of Lynch’s appeal. “It is impossible not to connect with her when you’re watching her onscreen.”\\nLynch says creating her Bond character was about working with Waller-Bridge and Fukunaga to shape a real woman. “I didn’t want someone who was slick. I wanted someone who was rough around the edges and who has a past and a history and has issues with her weight and maybe questions what’s going on with her boyfriend,” she says.\\nShe even talked to Waller-Bridge, who is only the second woman in the history of the franchise to be a credited writer after Johanna Harwood (1962’s Dr. No and 1963’s From Russia With Love), about adding an issue that nearly every woman faces but rarely makes its way into action films. “We had one conversation about her maybe being on her period in one scene, and maybe at the beginning of the scene — and I spoke to Cary about this — throwing her tampon in the thing,” says Lynch, making a motion of tossing trash into the bin. (She’s mum about whether it made it in.)\\nNo Time to Die suffered no shortage of offscreen drama. Though both Lynch and de Armas joined after the director switch-up (Danny Boyle was attached but dropped out over “creative differences”), they were both impacted when Craig sustained an ankle injury in May while filming in Jamaica and had to undergo surgery. “Daniel is fierce and wonderful, and I’m sure if his eyeball was falling out he’d still be at work giving his best and giving the best shots ever,” says Lynch, who continued filming while Craig recovered. De Armas’ schedule was shuffled, so she left for three months and returned in October to film her scenes.\\nAlong with London’s Pinewood, where the Cuba scenes were shot on a set, the cast filmed in Scotland, Italy, Norway and Jamaica, the latter of which was especially significant for Lynch, whose parents emigrated when they were teens. “There’s a heat and spice that comes with Jamaica that no matter what you’re shooting, whether it’s a drama or an action movie, you can’t help but feel that,” she says.\\nBeing a part of one of the biggest franchises in movie history — and one of the most secretive — brought its own challenges. Rumors leak, both true and not (for example, de Armas says reports of an intimacy coach being hired for her scenes with Craig are false). Everything the actresses say about the film makes headlines — and they can’t say much. In the lobby of the Charlotte Street Hotel, de Armas begins to talk about Paloma, then gets nervous. “I don’t know how much I can tell you,” she says. Five months out, only their character names have been officially confirmed, though when pressed, both actresses do divulge a little more than previously known.\\n“[Paloma] is a character that is very irresponsible,” says de Armas. “She’s got this bubbliness of someone who is excited to be on a mission, but she plays with this ambiguity — you don’t really know if she’s like a really trained, prepared partner for Bond.” Sure, de Armas is running around in a gorgeous gown with sky-high heels (“No one can train you or prepare you for that,” she says), but she adds that “brains and looks are equal this time. She’s very smart. She helps Bond navigate through certain things that he wouldn’t be able to do alone.”\\nSo far, the biggest leak about No Time to Die is that Lynch’s character begins the film having inherited the “007” designation from Bond, who has retired. (Lynch won’t confirm the rumor, but sources close to the film tell THR that it’s accurate.)\\nWhen the rumor leaked, the trolls on Twitter went crazy, with many people expressing fervent anger that a black woman was being named 007. Lynch says she’s been taking it in stride. “It doesn’t dishearten me. It makes me feel quite sad for some people because their opinions, they’re not even from a mean place — they’re actually from a sad place,” she says. “It’s not about me. People are reacting to an idea, which has nothing to do with my life.”\\nShe said every once in a while, she has messaged a hater back, usually saying something very nice. “Then they’ve been like, ‘Oh my gosh, thank you so much!’ But it’s an interesting test because it reminds them that they definitely wouldn’t say that to someone’s face,” she says, though she adds that she doesn’t plan on interacting with trolls anymore.\\nIt’s not only Lynch and de Armas who have a lot riding on No Time to Die, but also studio MGM, which for the first time will distribute the film via its United Artists Releasing banner co-owned with Annapurna (Universal is handling international). “Lashana and Ana both have that magical combination of a remarkable acting range matched with undeniable charisma,” says Jonathan Glickman, MGM’s Motion Picture Group president, noting that the team behind Bond is “committed to continuing to bring on emerging talents that allow the films to expand their relevance.”\\nIn the meantime, both actresses will remain busy until they take off on the global promotional tour ahead of the film’s release. In the new year, Lynch will shoot FX’s new series Y, based on the comic book series Y: The Last Man, set in a postapocalyptic world where women rule after a cataclysmic event leaves just one man alive. “Every female character has agency and is equipped to take over the world, which is a nice reflection of where the world — and our industry in particular — is going right now,” she says.\\nDe Armas’ Marilyn Monroe biopic Blonde, from Plan B and Netflix, is awaiting a release date. “It’s not what I think people think or have seen before about Marilyn,” she says. “It’s a very deep, raw, dark side of the same story we think we know — behind the smiles and the glamour.” She’s going straight from the Bond set to New Orleans to shoot New Regency’s erotic thriller Deep Water with Ben Affleck. She says, with a wry smile, “So maybe I’ll sleep next year, someday.”\\nRelated Stories\\nThis story first appeared in the Nov. 6 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

       "  'text': 'Ava DuVernay, Sterling Brown and more demand a #MeToo reckoning for women behind the camera | Salon.com Ava DuVernay, Sterling Brown and more demand a #MeToo reckoning for women behind the camera\\n#ReelEquity\\'s open letter has obtained almost 3,500 signatures so far, and it\\'s calling on others to sign it\\nPublished August 28, 2018 7:29AM (EDT)\\n(Getty/guruXOOX)\\n(Getty/guruXOOX)\\nIn many ways, the #MeToo movement has\\xa0forced Hollywood to confront some of its most persistent and harmful inequities, like manipulation of power as seen through systemic sexual harassment and abuse, gender pay gaps and representation. But much of the conversation has been centered around women in front of the camera.\\nNow the women behind the scenes are calling for a reckoning of their own. In an open letter, #ReelEquity, a collective of film professionals and supporters has\\xa0penned a demand to the entertainment industry calling for\\xa0an end to pay bias in the entertainment industry.\\n\"With pay equity and sexual harassment dominating the news, from the momentum of the #MeToo movement and the launch of TimesUp, to winning major concessions on closing the pay gap in state legislatures and corporate boardrooms, the time has come to take a hard look at how our industry compensates the many thousands of people who work below the line and insist on meaningful changes,\" the letter reads.\\nThe letter is endorsed by\\xa0organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, Women in Film and Women\\'s National Law Center, as well individuals like Ava DuVernay, Sterling Brown, Rosanna Arquette, Don Cheadle and Jane Fonda.\\n\"In 2016, the California Fair Pay Act took effect, changing state law to prohibit employers from paying women less than they pay men for \\'substantially similar work,\\'\" the letter continues. \"Nonetheless, a recent study commissioned by IATSE Local 871, a union representing over 2,500 production employees found that significant gender-based wage disparities continue to exist among workers in below-the-line occupations. The study identifies gender stereotyping, job segregation, and sexual harassment as factors contributing to gender pay inequality for below-the-line employees.\"\\nAnd while the study was conducted prior to the #MeToo explosion in Hollywood, \"an astonishing 52 percent of women surveyed said they had witnessed or experienced sexual harassment at work in the last three years alone,\" the letter says, illuminating the interconnectedness between \"the gender pay gap and other forms of workplace injustice facing women in Hollywood and beyond.\"\\nREAD MORE: Honoring Aretha Franklin, \"Queen of Soul,\" the greatest singer of our time\\nThe letter outlines action steps for the entertainment industry to follow in order to successfully combat the gender pay gap\\xa0for women behind the scenes, including the suggestion that all productions conduct a study of gender disparities in wages and then close the gap, and encourages the implementation of equity riders, which the letter describes as\\xa0similar to inclusion riders, that enforce productions to abide by equal pay going forward.\\nAnother important point that the letter emphasizes is that women are often\\xa0locked into lower pay simply because of their title or department, marginalized by jobs that have been historically female-majority. The labor study found that crafts like production coordinators, assistant production coordinators, art department coordinators and script supervisors are largely underpaid compared to their counterparts in more male-dominated crafts, even though the work load and responsibilities are similar. While the aforementioned positions are integral to a running production, often these jobs are paid just above minimum wage, according to the open letter.\\n\"A long history of gender segregation and stereotyping — and a current culture of gender bias and sexual harassment in film and television production — affects the work opportunities available to members of these female-dominated crafts and how the industry values their contributions,\" the study says, as these craft positions are paid hundreds and at times thousands of dollars per week less than comparable male-dominated crafts.\\n#ReelEquity\\'s open letter has obtained almost 3,500 signatures so far, and it\\'s calling on others to sign and support women behind the productions. \"With your help we can demonstrate that this issue has the support of our fellow industry members and the viewing audience at large,\" the letter concludes. \"We will be delivering this letter to the heads of major studios, networks and production companies as we push them to address this issue.\"\\nWhat\\'s next for #MeToo?\\nMeet the force behind the #MeToo movement.\\nBy Rachel Leah\\nMORE FROM Rachel Leah'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Gastritis - Symptoms and causes - Mayo Clinic Overview\\nGastritis is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common: Inflammation of the lining of the stomach. The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers or the regular use of certain pain relievers. Drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis.\\nGastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis) or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis). In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer. For most people, however, gastritis isn't serious and improves quickly with treatment.\\nSymptoms\\nGastritis doesn't always cause symptoms. When it does, the symptoms of gastritis may include:\\nGnawing or burning ache or pain, called indigestion, in your upper belly. This feeling may become either worse or better after eating.\\nNausea.\\nVomiting.\\nA feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating.\\nWhen to see a doctor\\nNearly everyone has had indigestion and stomach irritation at some point. Usually, indigestion doesn't last long and doesn't require medical care. See your healthcare professional if you have symptoms of gastritis for a week or longer.\\nSeek medical attention right away if you have severe pain or if you have vomiting where you cannot hold any food down. Also seek attention right away if you feel lightheaded or dizzy. Tell your healthcare professional if your stomach discomfort happens after taking medicines, especially aspirin or other pain relievers.\\nIf you are vomiting blood, have blood in your stools or have stools that appear black, see your healthcare professional right away to find the cause.\\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\\nSign up for free and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips, current health topics, and expertise on managing health.

The stomach lining is a mucus-lined barrier that protects the stomach wall. Weaknesses or injury to the barrier allows digestive juices to damage and inflame the stomach lining. Several diseases and conditions can increase the risk of gastritis. These include inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease.\\nRisk factors\\nFactors that increase your risk of gastritis include:\\nBacterial infection. A bacterial infection called Helicobacter pylori, also known as H. pylori, is one of the most common worldwide human infections. However, only some people with the infection develop gastritis or other upper gastrointestinal disorders. Healthcare professionals believe sensitivity to the germs could be inherited. Sensitivity also may be caused by lifestyle choices, such as smoking and diet.\\nRegular use of pain relievers. Pain relievers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, can cause both acute gastritis and chronic gastritis. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox DS). Using these pain relievers regularly or taking too much of these medicines may damage the stomach lining.\\nOlder age. Older adults have an increased risk of gastritis because the stomach lining tends to thin with age. Older adults also have an increased risk because they are more likely to have H. pylori infection or autoimmune disorders than younger people are.\\nExcessive alcohol use. Alcohol can irritate and break down your stomach lining. This makes your stomach more vulnerable to digestive juices. Excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute gastritis.\\nStress. Severe stress due to major surgery, injury, burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis.\\nCancer treatment. Chemotherapy medicines or radiation treatment can increase your risk of gastritis.\\nYour own body attacking cells in your stomach. Called autoimmune gastritis, this type of gastritis occurs when your body attacks the cells that make up your stomach lining. This reaction can wear away at your stomach's protective barrier.\\nAutoimmune gastritis is more common in people with other autoimmune disorders. These include Hashimoto's disease and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune gastritis also can be associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency.\\nOther diseases and conditions. Gastritis may be associated with other medical conditions. These may include HIV/AIDS, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, sarcoidosis and parasitic infections.\\nComplications\\nLeft untreated, gastritis may lead to stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding. Rarely, some forms of chronic gastritis may increase your risk of stomach cancer. This risk is increased if you have extensive thinning of the stomach lining and changes in the lining's cells.\\nTell your healthcare professional if your symptoms aren't improving despite treatment for gastritis.\\nFeb. 14, 2024\\nFeldman M, et al., eds.

       "  'text': 'Margot Robbie July 2019 Cover: The Actress on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Marriage, and MeToo | Vogue Margot Robbie on Quentin Tarantino, Marriage, and the One Word She Hates Being Called\\nMARGOT ROBBIE ALWAYS thought that once she was a good enough actor, she would write Quentin Tarantino a letter. Just to get on his radar. Or at least to let him know how much his movies meant to her. She was sure people must tell him that all the time. But still. “I’ve always been a huge—huge—Tarantino fan,” she tells me one afternoon in Los Angeles. “I love his movies. Love them.” After Robbie watched the first cut of I, Tonya, the 2017 biopic about figure skater Tonya Harding, which Robbie produced and starred in, she decided she was finally good enough. (The performance would earn her an Oscar nomination.) “So I wrote him and said, ‘I adore your films, and I would love to work with you in some capacity. Or any capacity.’ ”\\nWhen Tarantino received Robbie’s letter, he’d recently finished the script for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a romp through the movie industry of the late 1960s, which opens this month. Friends who’d read the script had already asked if he’d be casting Robbie in the role of Sharon Tate, the actress, wife of Roman Polanski, and most famous victim of the Manson murders. Then Robbie’s letter arrived. The timing was spooky enough that Tarantino thought they should meet. Soon Robbie was sitting at the director’s kitchen table, reading the script. Robbie is a careful reader; it took her four hours. Tarantino would occasionally pop in to offer her food or a Victoria Bitter, an Australian beer. When I later ask Tarantino what made Robbie right for the role, he tells me, “Margot looks like Sharon Tate. . . . And she can convey Sharon’s innocence and purity—those qualities are integral to the story.”\\nTarantino’s film is about the end of Hollywood’s Golden Age, but Robbie, who is 28, has come to represent so much of what’s new. As an Australian soap actress, she entered Hollywood being typecast. She played the bronzed, gold-digging beauty in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street, the hot blonde explaining mortgage bonds from a bubble bath in 2015’s The Big Short, and Jane following Alexander Skarsgård’s Tarzan into the Congo. But it turned out Robbie wanted more than these roles. It turned out she wanted to put on a fat suit for I, Tonya and to cover her face in boils for Mary Queen of Scots and to produce female-driven projects via her production company, LuckyChap Entertainment. Part of the charm in Robbie’s Tarantino story is that it—like the film itself—sounds very old Hollywood: An aspiring actress writes a fan letter to an auteur director in hopes of getting cast in one of his nostalgia-loving films. But Hollywood is changing, and while Robbie may have arrived at the end of an era, she is now among the women ushering in a new one.\\nToday we’re on the set of Birds of Prey, which Robbie developed and pitched to Warner Bros. as an R-rated, female-led superhero action film—a commercialized product of new Hollywood if ever there was one. “I think there’s a perception that a PG female-led action film is kind of considered a chick flick,” says Robbie.\\nAt $75 million, this is LuckyChap’s largest project to date, but Robbie seems unperturbed. “Well, we’re on schedule and on budget, which is a wonderful place to be.” In Birds, which is due out next year, Robbie will reprise her 2016 Suicide Squad role as Harley Quinn, the Joker’s ex. But today she’s primarily a producer. Wandering the set in jeans and a smiley-face T-shirt with two hearts for eyes, her cell phone suspended from a rope in place of a purse, she introduces me to the women who work with her: Cathy (Yan), the director; Jody, the script supervisor; Sue, a producer. We run into Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who has spent the day performing stunts as Huntress, a crossbow wielding vigilante. Winstead pulls down her track pants to reveal a bruise on her hip. “Shit,” Robbie says. “That looks legit.”\\nThe day’s shoot is at a medieval-style stone abbey in Highland Park. “Sorry I’m not taking you to paint mugs or something,” Robbie says. She’s referring to the tropes of celebrity profiles, the skydiving or skateboarding or whatever else actresses are supposed to do to charm writers. When I say that it is nearly impossible to find a story in which she’s not described as a “bombshell,” Robbie suppresses an eye roll. “I hate that word. I hate it—so much. I feel like a brat saying that because there are worse things, but I’m not a bombshell. I’m not someone who walks in a room and the record stops and people turn like, ‘Look at that woman.’ That doesn’t happen. People who know me, if they had to sum me up in one word I don’t know what that word would be, but I’m certain it would not be bombshell.”\\nWatch 73 Questions Over Brunch With Margot Robbie:\\nGlamorous movie star isn’t really Robbie’s vibe. She laughs easily, curses liberally, and is more likely to opt for a shared trailer if it means making room in the budget for something else. Here she is on the outlandish demands (or so she’s heard) of certain actors to have their bathtubs filled with Evian water: “They must have massive insecurities they’re compensating for.” And on the tribulations of life in New York, a city she has only sampled in stretches: “Fucking A—shit show!” Sophia Kerr, Robbie’s childhood friend and now–business partner, who met her as a braces-wearing, emo metal–listening pre-tween in Australia, describes Robbie as someone who “likes a good time,” whether it’s taking belly-dancing lessons in Marrakech, going to see Celine Dion in London, or trudging through mud at Glastonbury. Nicole Kidman, her costar in director Jay Roach’s forthcoming (and still untitled) Roger Ailes film, about sexual harassment at Fox News, calls Robbie a “powerhouse.” “She’s just got incredible ease,” Kidman says. “She seems to be unbelievably mature, and she’s managed to kind of float with everything. She doesn’t seem to have resistance. She’s very powerful in how she approaches her life and her work.” When I ask Kidman, a fellow Aussie, if she sees a difference between her own path in the industry and Robbie’s, she says, “I didn’t have the opportunity to produce my own things or control my destiny like that. So that is definitely different.”\\nA lot of actors want to be producers, but Robbie seems to actually think like one. On I, Tonya, it was common for her to skate off the ice to go over locations or to discuss budgets from the makeup chair. When Robbie landed her first American TV gig, on ABC’s short-lived Pan Am, she asked the cinematographer so many questions that one day he handed her a copy of The Five C’s of Cinematography. At home, in her bedroom closet, Robbie has written the classical structure of a screenplay on large swaths of butcher paper, so that she can give thoughtful notes while on calls with writers. Roach recalls their first meeting for the Ailes film, when Robbie nudged him to add layers to her character, a fictional Fox News associate producer. “She just sort of said, ‘I’m not great at playing naive,’ ” Roach says. “I thought, That’s excellent because a green newbie wouldn’t be nearly as interesting.\\nHarley Quinn, Suicide Squad’s baby-voiced psycho schoolgirl on roller skates, is not exactly a mascot for the emancipation of women in Hollywood. But when we drop by the wardrobe trailer so that Robbie can try on a costume intended for the next day’s shoot—a sequined blazer, sports bra, and orange track shorts—I notice that this Harley seems more Sporty Spice than male fantasy. “That’s what happens when you have a female producer, director, writer,” says the film’s costume designer, Erin Benach, who previously worked on A Star Is Born.\\n“Yeah, it’s definitely less male gaze–y,” Robbie says.\\nBenach tells me that Robbie “has an uncanny ability to focus on what’s happening in the moment, and when she needs to shift, she can so perfectly shift.” She turns to Robbie: “You kind of have a business mind.”\\n“God, I hope so,” Robbie says. “Or else this movie is going to fail!\\nBIRDS IS JUST ONE of some 50 projects on LuckyChap’s current slate. There’s also Promising Young Woman, a rape-revenge thriller starring Carey Mulligan, directed by actress Emerald Fennell (soon to play Camilla Parker Bowles on The Crown); Dollface, a Hulu comedy created by the 25-year-old writer Jordan Weiss; and a film adaptation of Ottessa Moshfegh’s novel My Year of Rest and Relaxation. Though LuckyChap’s overarching mission is promoting projects by women, Kerr sums up the company ethos thusly: “Margot once said to me, ‘Whenever we’re reading things, if your immediate reaction isn’t Fuck yes, then it’s a no.’ ”\\nThe company has just moved its offices to an industrial complex near downtown L.A. Inside there is a pink neon sign bearing the company name, Haim playing at a low volume, and Tom Ackerley, Robbie’s husband and LuckyChap cofounder, a bearded, easygoing Brit in a T-shirt and jeans, perched at the marble island of a pristine tiled kitchen.\\n“This kitchen has been dubbed a Nancy Meyers kitchen,” Ackerley tells me.\\n“Oh, it is so a Nancy Meyers kitchen,” Robbie says.\\nAckerley makes us coffee on the new espresso machine that Robbie hasn’t mastered yet and retreats to his office (“See ya!”). Press isn’t Ackerley’s thing, Robbie later tell me. “He’s usually a very loud and friendly person, but he’s definitely behind the cam,” she says.\\nThe story of how Robbie and Ackerley got together is also the story of LuckyChap. It all began in 2014, when Robbie was in London promoting The Wolf of Wall Street and she invited Kerr, as well as Ackerley and Josey McNamara, a couple of assistant directors she’d just met on the set of the film Suite Française, to the premiere. They ended up partying until the wee hours in her hotel room. In the morning, Robbie had to catch a flight to the Golden Globes. “I was like, ‘Ugh, wouldn’t it be fun if we all lived together?’ ” she recalls. Three days later, the foursome signed a lease on a house in London. That same year, they founded LuckyChap in their kitchen, and Robbie and Ackerley became a couple. (They married in 2016.)\\nIt’s nice working with your spouse, Robbie says. “We can talk about work all the time. And then work feels like fun. And fun stuff can involve work.” Fun stuff has recently included a weekend glamping in Big Sur and a Boogie Nights–themed party with friends, where Robbie dressed up as Roller Girl (naturally) and Ackerley was the silk robe–wearing drug dealer played by Alfred Molina. “We just get along,” she says. “I think it’s crazy that not all couples get along.”\\nIf Robbie likes a full house, it’s because she grew up in one—as the second youngest of four—on Australia’s Gold Coast, a beachy, surfy region along the country’s eastern edge. (“It’s kind of like Miami,” she says. “Lots of canals and tacky people.”) Her mother is a physiotherapist. She doesn’t love talking about her father, who left when she was five. “Just because it’s hard to briefly mention without it sounding like ‘My dad’s awful and. . . .’ That whole thing. But yes, Mum and Dad split up.” At seventeen, she moved to Melbourne, to work on a soap called Neighbours, followed by brief periods in Los Angeles and New York, before settling in London with Ackerley, Kerr, and McNamara. The story behind the name LuckyChap? Something to do with Charlie Chaplin. “We were drunk, and no one remembers,” Robbie says. “So it’s kind of like a shit tattoo. I have only shit tattoos.”\\nWhen they moved to Los Angeles, Robbie and Ackerley settled on their own, though currently they have Robbie’s older brother living with them, as well as her cousin and her cousin’s husband. “It’s a common theme, isn’t it?” she says. “I hate—hate—being alone.”\\nI don’t ask her about children. It was Robbie, after all, who made headlines in January by reminding everyone that such questions are not just tired but also sexist. (“I got married, and the first question in almost every interview is ‘Babies? When are you having one?’ ” she told a British weekly.) Lately she and Ackerley have been talking about forming a little commune with Kerr and McNamara, and touring double plots around the city. “We’ll be like a cult!” says Robbie. When they looked at one property, Robbie asked if she could have a slide built connecting her bedroom to the pool. “I think that just sums up the person that she is,” Kerr says. “She will buy a compound on a whim, so that her close friends could live near her and so that she can wake up and slide into the pool.”\\nSPEAKING OF CULTS, we are now en route to Musso & Frank’s, significant not just for its status as a Hollywood landmark but also as a pivotal setting in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The film follows a Western TV actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt), who live next door to Sharon Tate (Robbie). There are also takes on Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen, and a wild-eyed Charles Manson. And that’s pretty much all I can say. The project was shrouded in so much secrecy that even after signing an ironclad NDA, I was allowed to watch only a portion. Mostly, the film just feels like an incredibly fun party that you know is about to come to a terrible end.\\nRobbie’s Tate (like her Tonya Harding) is less imitation than an interpretation. Whereas Tate has always seemed ethereal and elusive, like someone in an old photograph, Robbie’s performance is exuberant and in full color, like a match that’s just been lit. Her prep for roles is often physical. In addition to Robbie’s usual Pilates routine, her stunt training ends up being her default workout. For Tonya, she learned to ice-skate. For Harley, it was roller-skating and fight-training. Becoming Tate was more complicated, with Robbie working with a movement coach doing something called “animal work” to accomplish Tate’s lightness and brightness; in one scene, she levitates midair. “It was such a strange challenge,” Robbie says. “I find it much easier to go dark and angry. With Tonya, I wanted to go really heavy, almost like she had weights on her feet. This time I was trying to do the reverse.”\\nWe’re outside the restaurant now, and the air smells of grilled steak, which Robbie inhales like a scented candle. “I’m such a carnivore,” she says. “I’m trying so hard to do meatless Mondays, for, like, environment reasons, but fuck, it’s hard.” Today is Thursday, so we order two filets and get back to the business of working with Tarantino. We haven’t talked about it yet, but Once Upon a Time is the first of Tarantino’s films not produced by Harvey Weinstein. It is also the director’s first release since the #MeToo movement and since . . . here Robbie finishes my thought: “The Uma Thurman thing?”\\nEarly last year, Thurman told The New York Times that she, too, had been assaulted by Weinstein, and that her relationship with Tarantino had suffered as a result. She held Weinstein’s studio, Miramax, responsible for injuries she sustained in a car crash on the set of 2003’s Kill Bill, and for suppressing footage of the accident that she ultimately released herself. According to Thurman, she’d asked Tarantino for a stunt double to drive the car, but Tarantino insisted that Thurman do it. And there were further details of the director’s quest for authenticity on that film—spitting on Thurman in one scene, choking her with a chain in another.\\nTarantino has never been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment. He called the car crash “one of the biggest regrets of my life.” Robbie tells me she was reassured by this and by the fact that Tarantino had helped make the footage public. “But the thought definitely crossed my mind,” Robbie says, “like, Will people view this decision as conflicting with what I’m doing on the producing side?\\n“I don’t know,” she continues. “I don’t know how to say what I feel about it, because I’m so grateful to be in a position of power and to have more creative control when that is embraced and encouraged now. At the same time, I grew up adoring movies that were the result of the previous version of Hollywood, and aspiring to be a part of it, so to have those dreams come true also feels incredibly satisfying. I don’t know. Maybe I’m having my cake and eating it too. . . .”\\nRobbie is answering this question because I asked, and it shouldn’t really fall to actresses to right the wrongs of Hollywood. The fact is that old power structures haven’t gone away, even as new ones are still emerging. “It would be easier, and so much more unfulfilling, not to have a production company,” Robbie says. “To not hire first- and second-time female directors, and stake millions of other people’s money, and put my name to it and everything I’ve worked for, but I’ve made the choice to do it, and I don’t regret it. On the flip side—and it doesn’t even feel like a flip side—it was my lifelong dream [to work with Tarantino], and I got to do it, and it makes me sad if people might hold that against me despite everything else I’m doing.”\\nIt’s difficult to parse out all the layers here. Tarantino’s film (which will premiere at Cannes several weeks after Robbie and I speak) is about a power shift in Hollywood’s history, one that ended the studio system and eventually created the space for indie masterpieces like Pulp Fiction. It also serves as a reminder of the best of what Hollywood can still do— assemble major movie stars for a film by a director with a singular vision, who can shut down Hollywood Boulevard in the middle of a weekday if he wants to. “Quentin told me, ‘You will never have more fun on a movie set.’ And he was right. I had the greatest experience of my life,” Robbie says. “There are some aspects of old Hollywood that are really wonderful and important and should be carried over. Do you erase history because there were some bad parts? Maybe it’s important for us at this juncture to acknowledge the good parts as well.”\\nIt is not 9:00 p.m. yet, but Robbie has to rush home to watch dailies from several LuckyChap projects currently in production. The next morning she’ll be on set at 4:30 a.m. to perform stunts as Harley, and at the office by 5:00 p.m., for what she calls a “half-day.” Though she spends her workdays watching films by female directors and reading scripts by female writers, when she goes home at night, Robbie tells me, she still likes to watch films like Snatch and Braveheart. “My love and passion for female filmmakers doesn’t mean I suddenly don’t like male-driven films,” she says. “And that’s an important argument to make—so that men go see films about women, by women. If it’s a good film, they’ll be able to relate.”\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story referenced the Gold Coast as being located on Australia’s western edge. It is, in fact, located on the east coast of the country.\\nMargot Robbie’s Beauty Routine Is Psychotically Perfect:'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Stomach Cancer And How To Recognize It | Cancer medical answers | Body & Health Conditions center | SteadyHealth.com Couldn't find what you looking for?\\nTRY OUR SEARCH!\\nCertain Central American countries, especially Nicaragua, have very high rates of stomach cancer. They also have endemic infections with Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium associated with gastric\\xa0and duodenal ulcers (peptic ulcer disease). There are very high rates of stomach cancer in parts of South America, especially Chile, Japan, and parts of the former Soviet Union. In the United States, Canada, and Europe, stomach cancer is the fifteenth most common form of cancer, but there are so many cases of stomach cancer in a few countries that is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide.\\nThat doesn't mean, however, that everyone who gets stomach (gastric) cancer dies of it. Chances of survival increase with early diagnosis. The problem with early diagnosis is that some cases of stomach cancer don't present symptoms at early stages of diagnosis, and others just present one or two symptoms from the following list:\\nDysphagia, or inability to swallow\\xa0food or drink.\\nFeeling full after eating.\\nHematemesis, vomiting up blood.\\nPost-prandial (after a meal) fullness.\\nIndigestion.\\nNausea and/or vomiting.\\nMelena (black or tarry feces).\\nOnly as the tumor or tumors begin to grow and spread will symptoms possibly include:\\nPleural effusions, accumulation of fluid in the space around the lungs.\\nPressure causing obstruction of either the gastric outlet, where the stomach empties into the small intestine, or the small intestine itself.\\nInanition, exhaustion from lack of nourishment.\\nJaundice as tumors cause hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver).\\nCachexia, leading to wasting of the muscles as the body burns calories at a faster rate even while it receives calories at a slower rate.\\nPeople come in with what they think is a different complaint, because they have just one or maybe two of the symptoms most often associated with stomach cancer, and then the doctor discovers that cancer is the problem. However, there are other\\xa0conditions that present some of the same symptoms. These conditions include:\\nAcute gastritis, inflammation of the lining of the stomach, usually caused by Helicobacter pylori. This is a burning or gnawing pain that may either improve or get worse after eating.\\nChronic gastritis, which may also be caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, but which causes neurological symptoms due to the inability to the digestive tract to receive vitamin B12. Chronic gastritis can also cause anemia.\\nEsophageal cancer, cancer of the tube between the throat and stomach. Before 1990, the most common predisposing factor for esophageal cancer was smoking. Now, it most commonly occurs in people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD.\\nEsophageal stricture, a narrowing of the esophagus, which may also cause odynophagia (painful swallowing), dysphagia (inability to swallow, at first an inability to swallow solid foods followed by an inability to swallow liquids), and asthma and cough, due to acid coming up through the esophagus when swallowing is successful.\\nEsophagitis, inflammation of the esophagus, which may be caused by a yeast infection or GERD. Symptoms include water brash, a bad taste in the mouth, and intense heartburn. Symptoms are made worse by bending at the waist or wearing tight clothes.\\nNon-Hodgkin's or Burkitt's lymphoma, which will also tend to cause night sweats. In these conditions, the problem is an abdominal mass, which may cause protruding belly even without weight gain.\\nPeptic ulcer disease (gastric or duodenal ulcers), which tends to produce symptoms that are worse at night, or that cycle over the course of 24 hours, and intolerance of fatty foods.\\nViral gastroenteritis, which normally clears up in a week or less even without treatment.\\nSymptoms that could mean stomach cancer usually don't mean stomach cancer. It's unusual to be diagnosed with the condition, especially outside of Latin America or Japan. The only way to know for sure that you don't have stomach cancer, however, is to seek a medical diagnosis, preferably as soon as possible after you notice symptoms.\\nStill have something to ask?\\nGet help from other members!\\nPost Your Question On The Forums\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Gastritis treatment | Stomach problems discussions | Body & Health Conditions center | SteadyHealth.com Couldn\\'t find what you looking for?\\nTRY OUR SEARCH!\\nI have had pain in my stomach for some time. I also felt nausea and was vomiting. I went to my doctor and she told me that I have gastritis. I would like to know more about this condition. What is the treatment for gastritis?\\nLoading...\\nGastritis is combination of several different condidions that all have one thing incommon and that is inflammation of the stomach lining. So, gastritis is not a single disease. It can be caused by drinking too much of alcohol, by major surgery, bacterial infection, traumatic injury etc. Some diseases can cause gastritis, like: chronic bile reflux, autoimmune disorders, pernicious anemia and many others. Gastritis has many symptoms. The most common are abdominal upset and pain. Other symptoms are nausea and vomiting, like in your case, feeling of fullnes, burning in the upper abdomen etc. Gastritis is diagnosed through medical tests like upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, blood test and stool test. Treatment of gastritis usually involves medications to reduce stomach acid and to relieve symptoms. Also, avoiding certain drinks and food can help in the healing process. If the condition is caused by bacterial infection then the doctor might proscribe antibiotics. We hope that we gave you enough information.\\nReply\\nLoading...\\nI\\'m an occasional gastritis sufferer. I have had it off and on for about 10 years now. I\\'ve noticed that it\\'s more frequent when I\\'m heavier and when I eat fatty foods and drink acidic drinks (soft drinks, margaritas, etc.).\\nThe only thing that has ever made it stop quickly was the \"GI cocktail\" given at the ER. At home, I rely on Maalox. If I catch it quickly with Maalox, it usually goes away in about 15 minutes. If I don\\'t get it quickly, it may last a few hours.\\nFor me, the pain is usually in the upper-front area of the stomach. Taking the Maalox and then taking a \"sitting forward\" position seems to work the best. Lying on the back is the worst.\\nReply\\nLoading...\\nYeah I second everything you said in your post...\\nReply\\nLoading...'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Schizophrenia symptoms Schizophrenia symptoms\\nReading time: 5 min\\nSchizophrenia is an extraordinarily complex disease because it combines a multitude of symptoms. To assist in its identification, the symptoms have been divided into four large subgroups:\\nPositive sign\\npositive symptoms,\\nNegative sign\\nnegative symptoms,\\nHeart icon\\nemotional or affective symptoms, and\\nIcon of a brain\\ncognitive symptoms.\\nIt is important to explain that the terms positive or negative do not mean that the symptoms are good or bad. Psychiatrists use the concept of positive psychiatry to refer to something that was not present in the past, whereas the term negative psychiatry defines the loss of a previously acquired ability or trait.\\nWhat are positive symptoms?\\nThe positive (or psychotic or reality distortion) symptoms of schizophrenia can be grouped into three types:\\nDelusions. These are false beliefs. Patients present a specific conviction that does not follow logical thinking.\\nHallucinations. These are sensory errors. Patients hear voices or see things in the absence of a genuine stimulus. There are as many different types of hallucinations as there are sensory organs: auditory, visual, tactile, etc.\\nBehavioural disorganisation. Disorganisation can be observed in both the patient’s thoughts and their behaviour. Disorganised thinking is evident when a patient’s speech becomes less comprehensible or when they repeatedly iterate the same idea, sentence or even a single syllable. This tendency sometimes evolves and the person’s ideas do not follow a semantic order (agrammatism) or logical argument (disaggregated or slow thinking), which leads to unintelligible or incoherent speech. When the disorganisation affects behaviour, patients may be restless and even become agitated or violent for no apparent cause. This behaviour can sometimes accelerate to such an extent that it paradoxically leads to a state of absolute immobility, with rigid arms and legs, called catatonia.\\nFor the family and people close to the patient, these positive symptoms often constitute the first warning sign announcing the disease’s presence and the reason why they visit a specialist for the first time, although the patient may have already been suffering other less notable symptoms for weeks or months.\\nWe must not forget that, although they create disbelief and amazement in those around them when they first announce their experiences, the patient’s delusions and hallucinations are absolutely real for them; they are totally convinced they exist and therefore act according to their distorted reality.\\nDue to the presence of these symptoms and their absolute conviction of the reality in which they are living, patients behave according to these influences. This type of behaviour is often what first warns the family about the condition, even when the patient has still not explained what is happening to them. People around the patient will notice that they:\\nbecome more suspicious of others,\\nbelieve many things happening around them are their concern (self-referentiality),\\nbecome very vigilant or fearful, as if expecting to be attacked at any moment,\\nare distrusting, they avoid contact with others and tend to isolate themselves out of fear, and\\noften speak to themselves or listen to very loud music to block out the annoying voices inside their heads.\\nWhat are negative symptoms?\\nNegative symptoms are associated with:\\nreduced ability to feel or experience emotions,\\na loss of motivation,\\ndifficulty to enjoy themselves, and\\na reduction in verbal expression.\\nThese symptoms frequently appear before the positive symptoms, but as they are usually less evident, they may go unnoticed during the early stages of the disease. Their presence determines the long-term prognosis for patients because they have a much greater impact on adaptive capacity than other symptoms.\\nWhat are the affective symptoms of schizophrenia?\\nAs a general rule, patients with schizophrenia will also present depressive symptoms. Two situations are typically associated with the appearance of depressive symptoms in schizophrenics. The first is during the onset of the disease, when patients experience the initial psychotic symptoms and the strangeness of the world around them. The second, more common situation occurs after the delusional or hallucinatory (reality distortion) symptoms have remitted, when the patient is diagnosed and becomes aware of their condition and the consequences that they must overcome.\\nWhat are cognitive symptoms?\\nPatients with schizophrenia present decreased capacities in certain aspects or cognitive domains, such as attention span, working memory or executive functions, those which allow us to plan, anticipate and order our actions. In one way or another, these patients may manifest a loss of some of these intellectual capacities, which is why, for a long time, schizophrenia was known as “early dementia”. Specialists can determine the degree of dysfunction, which varies greatly between patients, by means of neuropsychological tests designed to measure what are known as mental, superior or cognitive functions.\\nDisease onset and progression\\nGiven the large variation in how the disease manifests, there is no unique clinical course. The disorder may arise in different ways, according to various pathological routes, and so each case is different.\\nThe most exemplary case is that of slow onset. Weeks or months pass before somebody finally notices that something strange is happening. The initial (prodromal) symptoms are similar to other mental illnesses, such as depression, a tendency towards isolation, decreased workplace or academic performance, disregard for personal care, disinterest in social relationships, etc. Other warning symptoms progressively start to become evident, e.g., irritability, suspicious nature, hostility and strange explanations for their own behaviour, demonstrating that the affected person is suffering from more than just a period of sadness.\\nOnce installed, the disease is characterised by the patient’s distorted perception of reality, including delusions and hallucinations. In fact, it is not uncommon for months (or even years) to pass in which the patient has adapted to their distorted reality and they only display a few occasional and unexplainable idiosyncrasies before being diagnosed and treated.\\nSubstantiated information by:\\nEduard Parellada Rodon\\nMiguel Bernardo Arroyo\\nMiquel Bioque Alcázar\\nPublished: 20 February 2018\\nUpdated: 30 November 2022\\nThe donations that can be done through this webpage are exclusively for the benefit of Hospital Clínic of Barcelona through Fundació Clínic per a la Recerca Biomèdica and not for BBVA Foundation, entity that collaborates with the project of PortalClínic.\\nSubscribe\\nReceive the latest updates related to this content.\\nThank you for subscribing!\\nIf this is the first time you subscribe you will receive a confirmation email, check your inbox\\nAn error occurred and we were unable to send your data, please try again later.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Heart Attack & Stroke: Is Daily Low-Dose Aspirin Therapy Safe? Aspirin Therapy Guidelines\\nWhat is aspirin?\\nAspirin belongs to a class of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin and other NSAIDs like ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, etc.) and naproxen (Aleve, etc.), are widely used to treat fever, pain, and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, and bursitis. Aspirin has also been widely recommended for prevention of complications from athroscleotic disorders (heart attack, stroke and peripheral vascular disease). Aspirin is known chemically as acetyl salicylic acid and often abbreviated as ASA.\\nWhat is aspirin therapy?\\nAspirin also has an important inhibitory effect on platelets in the blood. This antiplatelet effect is used to prevent clotting of blood inside arteries, particularly in individuals who have atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) or are otherwise prone to develop blood clots in their arteries.\\nWhat are the side effects of aspirin?\\nSerious side effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs occur infrequently and generally tend to be more frequent with higher doses. It is advisable to use the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects.\\nThe most common side effects of aspirin involve the gastrointestinal system, and include\\nUlcers of the stomach and duodenum (first part of the small intestine)\\nAbdominal pain\\nNausea\\nGastritis (inflammation of the stomach)\\nEven serious gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers\\nOther side effects of aspirin include:\\nSometimes, ulcers of the stomach and bleeding occur without any abdominal pain, and the only signs of bleeding may be:\\nAnother serious but rare side effect of aspirin is intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the tissues of the brain), similar to a hemorrhagic stroke.\\nAspirin can impair kidney and liver function, especially in patients who already have liver and kidney disease.\\nOccasionally, aspirin may be toxic to the liver.\\nSerious side effects of aspirin, such as bleeding ulcers or intracranial bleeding, are rare (less than 1% of patients) among patients taking moderate doses of aspirin (for example, 325 mg/day). Serious side effects of aspirin should be even lower with low doses such as 75-160 mg/day. However, the actual incidence of serious bleeding with long-term use of low dose aspirin has not been clearly determined.\\nThese serious side effects also have been associated with aspirin:\\nThrombocytopenia (reduced blood platelets)\\nAplastic anemia (reduced production of red blood cells)\\nHemolytic anemia (increased destruction of red blood cells)\\nNeutropenia (reduction of white blood cells)\\nPancytopenia (reduction of all cells in the blood\\nAgranulocytosis (reduction of one type of white blood cell)\\nThromboembolism\\nHypoprothrombinemia\\nBronchospasm\\nAngioedema\\nSalicylism\\nSerious allergic reactions\\nSome individuals are allergic to NSAIDs and may develop shortness of breath when an NSAID is taken. People with asthma are at a higher risk for experiencing serious allergic reaction to NSAIDs. Individuals with a serious allergy to one NSAID are likely to experience a similar reaction to a different NSAID.\\nWhat are the latest recommendations on the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of heart (cardiovascular) disease?\\nIn 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued their final recommendations for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease using aspirin. Based on their review of the published data:\\nThey encourage the use of low-dose aspirin in adults aged 50 to 59 years with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years.\\nAdults who are 60 to 69 and have high risk of cardiovascular disease may receive daily aspirin based on individual circumstances. According to the recommendations, persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit. Persons who place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may choose to initiate low-dose aspirin.\\nIn individuals younger than 50 years of age and older than 70 years of age, the data is insufficient to recommend daily aspirin.\\nIn 2014 the FDA reviewed all the evidence on the use of aspirin for primary prevention and did not find sufficient evidence for use of aspirin for primary prevention.\\nSLIDESHOW\\nHeart Disease: Causes of a Heart Attack See Slideshow\\nWhat dosage of aspirin should I take to prevent and treat heart attacks and strokes?\\nAn ideal dose of aspirin is one that maximizes its benefits but minimizes side effects. The ideal dose of aspirin for primary or secondary prevention of ischemic strokes and heart attacks has not been established firmly.\\nIn situations where an immediate antiplatelet effect is needed (for example, in the treatment of acute heart attacks, ischemic strokes, and unstable angina) aspirin at moderate doses (160–325 mg/day) will produce rapid and immediate antiplatelet effects. In the ISIS-2 trial, a dose of 160 mg/day given within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of heart attack was shown to decrease deaths due to heart attacks by 23%. Therefore, this is the dose recommended for acute heart attacks and unstable angina.\\nAt lower doses, such as 75 mg/day, the antiplatelet effect of aspirin can be achieved in several days instead of minutes. Since the risk of serious bleeding from aspirin is lower at lower doses, 75 mg/day is an appropriate dose for long-term primary and secondary prevention. Even though aspirin at doses as low as 40 mg/d has been shown to have anti-platelet effects, there is insufficient and inconclusive data to show that such low doses are effective in preventing heart attacks and ischemic strokes.\\nThere also is no evidence that higher doses of aspirin, such as 1000 mg/day or higher, is more effective than lower doses. Some studies even suggest that higher doses may not be as effective as lower doses. Since the side effects of aspirin are more frequent with higher doses, doctors generally do not recommend higher doses for long-term use.\\nHow effective is aspirin for preventing heart attacks among healthy people?\\nLong-term, low dose aspirin (75-160 mg/day) infrequently causes serious side effects. Among people with advanced atherosclerosis (people who already have heart attacks and strokes, patients with angina or TIAs, and patients who need PTCA and coronary artery bypass surgery). The benefits of low dose aspirin usually outweigh the risks of long-term aspirin (discussed in this article).\\nUnlike the treatment of patients with advanced atherosclerosis, aspirin use among healthy subjects (for example, individuals with no prior heart attacks or strokes) is more controversial. In the U.S. Physicians\\' Health Study (a study comparing 325 mg of aspirin every other day to placebo among more than 20,000 healthy male doctors), there were fewer heart attacks among aspirin users as compared to placebo users. However, the overall rate of death from heart disease was no different between aspirin users and men on placebo. Furthermore, there is insufficient data to evaluate the benefit of aspirin among healthy women.\\nThe potential benefits of long-term aspirin in healthy subjects may not justify the risks of serious side effects of aspirin, including bleeding from ulcers and blood vessels in the brain. Healthy individuals should discuss long-term therapy with aspirin with their doctors before they start taking aspirin.\\nWho should take aspirin to prevent and treat heart attacks and strokes?\\nEven though aspirin is available without a doctor\\'s prescription and has been used safely for many years by patients for fever and pain, patients should NOT take aspirin on a long-term basis without consulting with their doctor.\\nAspirin prevents blood clots from forming inside arteries affected by atherosclerosis, but aspirin does not prevent atherosclerosis. Other measures (such as losing excess weight, controlling high blood pressure and diabetes, lowering LDL cholesterol, increasing HDL cholesterol, and stopping cigarette smoking) are necessary to prevent atherosclerosis.\\nMost doctors now recommend low doses of aspirin long-term for patients with advanced atherosclerosis for secondary prevention purposes. Such patients include those with:\\nPeople who have not had a heart attack or stroke but have a high risk for developing a heart attack or stroke should also receive long-term low dose aspirin. For example, the American Diabetes Association recommends that people 50 years of age or older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have a high risk for heart attacks or strokes because of hypertension, smoking, a family history of stroke or heart attacks, or abnormal lipid levels should receive aspirin daily. Adults age 50 to 59 with a high risk of cardiovascular disease may also be considered for low dose aspirin treatment.\\nWho should not take aspirin to prevent heart attacks and strokes?\\nPeople who should not take aspirin include:\\nPeople with an allergy to aspirin or other NSAIDs.\\nPeople with active ulcers, especially those with bleeding ulcers, because of the side effects of ulcers and bleeding with aspirin. Among people who must take aspirin but have had intestinal ulcers, the lowest doses of aspirin should be used only after the ulcers heal. It should also be taken together with a proton pump inhibitor such as pantoprazole (Protonix), esomeprazole (Nexium), rabeprazole (Aciphex), or lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid SoluTab) to decrease the risk of recurrent ulcers.\\nPregnant women and nursing mothers (since aspirin is secreted into breast milk).\\nTeenagers and children with the flu or chickenpox because of the associated risk of Reye\\'s syndrome, a serious disease of the liver and nervous system that can lead to coma and death.\\nPeople with advanced kidney or liver diseases since aspirin may cause toxicity to the kidney and liver.\\nPeople at risk for developing intracranial hemorrhage.\\nSome people undergoing elective surgery or procedures. (Patients taking aspirin should discuss with their doctors whether to stop aspirin for several days to up to two weeks before surgery and procedures to avoid excess bleeding.)\\nAccording to the FDA there is no good evidence supporting the use of aspirin to prevent a heart attack or stroke in people who have a low risk of developing a heart attack or stroke.\\nWhen is aspirin used for preventing and treating heart attacks and strokes?\\nAspirin is widely used either alone or in combination with other antiplatelet agents to prevent blood clots from forming in arteries. Aspirin is used specifically in several situations including:\\nAspirin often is prescribed in moderate doses (160-325 mg/day) for people who are having heart attacks to limit the extent of damage to the heart\\'s muscle (by preventing further blood clot formation in the blood vessels of the heart and reduction of blood flow), prevent additional heart attacks, and improve survival.\\nAspirin often is prescribed to patients undergoing surgery to open or bypass blocked arteries, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without placement of coronary stents and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Aspirin also is prescribed on a long-term basis to prevent clotting in the stents and/or the bypassed blood vessels.\\nAspirin often is prescribed in low doses (75-160 mg/day) on a long-term basis to patients with prior heart attacks or strokes and to patients with TIAs (transient ischemic attacks or mini-strokes) and exertional angina to prevent heart attacks and ischemic strokes.\\nAspirin is prescribed in moderate doses (160-325 mg/day) to patients who are having unstable angina to prevent heart attacks and improve survival.\\nAspirin is prescribed in moderate doses (160-325 mg/day) to selected patients who are having ischemic strokes to limit damage to the brain, prevent a second stroke, and improve survival.\\nAspirin for treatment of heart attacks\\nIn a large multi-center study (Second International Study of Infarct Survival of the ISIS-2 trial) of patients having acute heart attacks, early treatment (within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms) with aspirin (160 mg/d) was found to reduce deaths from the heart attacks by 23%. The improved survival is believed to be due to aspirin\\'s ability to quickly prevent further blood clots and the extension of existing clots and thus limit the amount of damage to the heart\\'s muscle.\\nAspirin is easy to use, safe at the low doses used for its antiplatelet action, and fast acting. Aspirin at moderate doses (160-325 mg/day) produces an antiplatelet effect rapidly (within 30 minutes). The current recommendation is to give aspirin immediately to almost all patients as soon as a heart attack is recognized at a dose of 160-325 mg/d and to continue it for one month. The only reason for not using aspirin is a history of intolerance or allergy to aspirin or evidence of obvious active bleeding (such as actively bleeding stomach ulcers) that might be worsened by aspirin.\\nPerformance of vascular procedures\\nAspirin is not the only treatment for heart attacks and unstable angina. Sometimes percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty (PTCA), with or without placement of an arterial stent, is necessary to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. In rare instances, PTCA may be technically impossible, or not practical, to do, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) becomes necessary to improve the flow of blood to the heart.\\nSome patients with heart attacks also may be treated with thrombolytic agents (medications that dissolve clots) to open blocked arteries. It is important to make the distinction that aspirin generally does not dissolve an existing blood clot, but it acts to prevent growth of the existing clot and the formation of new ones. In all of these instances, there is a risk blood clots will form again inside the arteries, leading to further heart attacks. In all of these cases, aspirin has been shown to be beneficial in preventing new clots, thus reducing the risk of heart attacks and improving both short and long-term survival.\\nPrevention of further heart attacks\\nThere are two types of heart attack prevention, primary and secondary. Preventing the first heart attack in people who do not have a history of heart disease is called primary prevention. Preventing further heart attacks among patients who already have had a heart attack or another heart related condition is called secondary prevention.\\nWithin six years after the first heart attack, 16% of men and 35% of women will have a second heart attack. Long-term, daily aspirin (75-325 mg/d) has been shown to reduce the risk of second heart attacks and improve survival among both men and women. Additionally, long-term secondary prevention with aspirin also has resulted in fewer ischemic (lack of blood flow due to blockage in blood vessels from clot formation) strokes. Survivors of heart attacks usually take daily low dose (75 mg-160 mg/d) aspirin indefinitely to prevent further heart attacks as well as strokes.\\nAspirin taken long-term is an important part but NOT the only measure for preventing heart attacks. Aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention of heart attacks because available evidence does not support its use for primary prevention.\\nSubscribe to MedicineNet\\'s Heart Health Newsletter\\nBy clicking \"Submit,\" I agree to the MedicineNet Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

The Canadian Multicenter Trial, and the Montreal Heart Institute study all demonstrated significant reductions (approximately 50%) in the risk of heart attack among patients with unstable angina treated with aspirin. A study by the Research on Instability in Coronary Artery Disease Group (RISC) showed a 70% reduction in the risk of death or heart attack in patients with unstable angina treated with aspirin. Aspirin usually is started as soon as the diagnosis of unstable angina is made and then continued indefinitely.\\nIn patients with prolonged chest pain due to unstable angina (a situation in which heart attacks are frequent), percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stenting may be necessary to open blocked coronary arteries. Aspirin is often used in combination with another antiplatelet agent, such as eptifibatide (Integrilin), and an anti-coagulant (heparin or low molecular weight heparin) to prevent heart attacks while awaiting the PTCA procedure. Aspirin then is used long-term (either alone or in combination with another antiplatelet agent) to prevent blood clots from forming inside the coronary arteries and stents.\\nIn patients with exertional angina (chest pain brought on by exertion), low dose aspirin (75 mg-325 mg daily) given long-term has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks, sudden death, and ischemic strokes.\\nAspirin for treatment of ischemic strokes\\nIschemic stroke is a process similar to a heart attack. In general, ischemia means injury to a tissue in the body due to lack of blood flow, and an ischemic stroke is injury to the brain tissue due to lack of blood perfusion. This usually happens because of atherosclerosis (narrowing and hardening of the blood vessels) of the arteries in the brain. Heart attack is the ischemia of the heart caused by similar process. Another major process for ischemic stroke may be due to an embolism (a blood clot that dislodges and travels from some other location in the body) to the blood vessels in the brain stopping blood from passing through the blood vessel.\\nWhen aspirin at moderate doses (160-350 mg/day) is given to patients as soon as an ischemic stroke is recognized (usually within the first 48 hours of the onset of symptoms), survival is improved, and the risk of additional strokes is reduced. Aspirin is believed to benefit patients having acute ischemic strokes by preventing the propagation (extension or growth) of the blood clots and preventing the complete obstruction of the arteries. However, aspirin is not effective in treating or preventing hemorrhagic strokes. Some studies suggest that long-term aspirin use may increase slightly the risk of developing hemorrhagic strokes.\\nAspirin is not the preferred treatment for ischemic strokes. Thrombolytic medications (medications that dissolve clots) are used early (as soon as an ischemic stroke is recognized) to open blocked cerebral arteries.\\nThe major limitation for using these medications is time. For example, for an ischemic stroke, thrombolytics must be given within the first three hours after the first symptoms of a stroke. Many people with strokes may not recognize the symptoms and may delay medical attention for several hours if not days after the onset of stroke symptoms.\\nAnother limitation in their use is that only certain patients qualify to receive these medications. As a result, for patients in whom thrombolytic medications cannot be used (most often because of underlying conditions that can cause excessive bleeding), doctors may consider using aspirin. Thus, aspirin is often the drug that patients with stroke will receive when they are seen in the emergency room.\\nPrevention of strokes\\nPatients with prior strokes and TIAs (mini-strokes) usually have significant atherosclerosis of the carotid and /or the smaller arteries within the brain and are at risk of further strokes. (These patients often have coronary atherosclerosis as well and are at risk for heart attacks.) Long-term low-to-moderate doses of aspirin (50-325 mg/d) have been found to reduce the risk of strokes as well as heart attacks in these patients.\\nAspirin is not the only medication to prevent strokes among patients with atherosclerosis. Another anti-platelet agent, clopidogrel (Plavix), also has been used, especially in patients who are intolerant or allergic to aspirin. Aspirin is sometimes combined with a second anti-platelet agent, dipyridamole (Persantine, Aggrenox), to prevent strokes.\\nAntiplatelet agents are not the only measures that prevent strokes. For example, aspirin alone may not be sufficient to prevent embolic strokes in patients at risk for this type of stroke, such as in patients with atrial fibrillation. In these patients, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), an oral anti-coagulant that is a stronger anti-clotting medication than aspirin, may be necessary.\\nIn patients with ischemic strokes or TIAs who have advanced atherosclerosis and narrowing of the carotid arteries, carotid endarterectomy (a surgical procedure to widen the narrowed carotid artery, the main blood vessel feeding the brain) or the introduction of stents within the carotid artery may be necessary to prevent strokes.\\nWhat is aspirin allergy?\\nAllergy to aspirin is a rare condition in which a patient can develop swelling of tissues, spasm of the airways (bronchospasm) that causes difficulty breathing, and even anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition. Patients with a history of allergy to aspirin should not take aspirin. Since aspirin is related chemically to the other NSAIDs, patients who are allergic to the other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), also should not take aspirin.\\nWhat drugs might interact with aspirin?\\nAspirin may interact with other medications and cause undesirable side effects. For example:\\nAspirin, when taken together with an anti-coagulant such as warfarin (Coumadin) or enoxaparin (Lovenox), can greatly impair the body\\'s ability to form blood clots, resulting in excessive bleeding spontaneously, from ulcers, or related to a procedure. Patients on such combinations must be closely monitored by a doctor.\\nAspirin can raise levels of uric acid in the blood and may need to be avoided in patients with increased uric acid levels or gout.\\nAspirin can increase the effect of medications used for lowering blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes, resulting in abnormally low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). Blood sugar levels may need to be more closely monitored.\\nCertain NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), if taken just before aspirin or in multiples doses each day, can reduce the anti-platelet effects of aspirin and theoretically render aspirin less effective in preventing heart attacks and ischemic strokes. The ibuprofen molecule is believed to adhere to the COX-1 enzyme, thus keeping aspirin from reaching the enzyme.\\nIMAGES\\nHeart Illustration Browse through our medical image collection to see illustrations of human anatomy and physiology See Images\\nWhat can be done to reduce the risk of ulcers from long-term aspirin use?\\nLong-term low dose aspirin use is generally safe. An estimated 10% of the patients taking long-term aspirin (75-325 mg/day) can develop ulcers. Most of these ulcers were asymptomatic (no abdominal pain or bleeding). Patients at a higher risk of developing ulcers with low dose aspirin included elderly patients age 70 years and older, and patients with H. pylori stomach infection (see below). The risk of significant ulcer bleeding from aspirin is low (approximately 1%). One can reduce the risk of bleeding by adding a daily dose of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid, for example, pantoprazole (Protonix), esomeprazole (Nexium), rabeprazole (Aciphex), or lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid SoluTab), and omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid).\\nMisoprostil (Cytotec) is another type of drug that prevents ulcer formation by NSAIDs. It is a prostaglandin and probably prevents the detrimental effects of NSAIDs by replacing the prostaglandins that are not produced because of the inhibition of their formation by NSAIDs.\\nChronic H. pylori infection of the stomach is found in up to 30% of adults in the U.S. Patients with gastritis due to H. pylori will have a higher risk of bleeding when given aspirin or NSAIDs long-term. Eradication of H. pylori from the stomach with antibiotics can reduce the risk of bleeding from chronic aspirin use.\\nBuffered and coated aspirin do not seem to prevent ulcers and ulcer bleeding.\\nWhat are the limitations of aspirin treatment?\\nAspirin is not always effective in preventing strokes and heart attacks. Examples of possible causes of aspirin failure include:\\nPoor patient compliance (not taking the medication regularly)\\nInadequate dosing\\nConcurrent intake of other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen that interfere with the anti-platelet action of aspirin\\nActivation of platelet aggregation via pathways not blocked by aspirin\\nAspirin resistance\\nWhat is aspirin resistance?\\nAspirin resistance can be defined as the lack of antiplatelet effect despite therapeutic doses of aspirin (75mg-150mg/day for at least five days). This lack of anti-platelet response to aspirin increases the risk of developing heart attacks, strokes, and related deaths. Aspirin resistance is different from other causes of aspirin failure (see above), such as patient non-compliance or drug interference from concomitant use of ibuprofen.\\nSome scientists believe a segment of the population is resistant to the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. In these aspirin-resistant individuals, aspirin does not inhibit the formation of thromboxane A-2. Resistant individuals can be identified in research settings by finding high levels of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (a metabolic breakdown product of thromboxane A-2) in the urine while taking aspirin. These individuals have a higher risk of heart attack and strokes than subjects with lower urine levels of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2.\\nAnother way of identifying aspirin resistance in research settings is by optical platelet aggregation. Aspirin non-responders identified by this method were found to have higher rates of heart attacks, strokes, and death than aspirin responders.\\nWhat is in the future for the research on aspirin resistance?\\nWhile research scientists are increasingly convinced that aspirin resistance exists, there are no reliable and standardized tests that doctors in clinical practice can use to diagnose this condition. Large scale controlled studies are needed to validate and standardize laboratory tests of aspirin resistance, and link these tests results to clinical outcomes.\\nClinical trials will also be needed to determine how best to treat aspirin resistance. For example, should patients diagnosed as having aspirin resistance be treated with higher doses of aspirin? Should they be treated with aspirin in combination with another anti-platelet agent? Or should they be treated with a different anti-platelet agent, such as clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix)?\\nSLIDESHOW\\nHeart Disease: Causes of a Heart Attack See Slideshow\\nTreatment & Diagnosis\\nMedications & Supplements\\nPrevention & Wellness\\nMedically Reviewed by a Doctor on 7/29/2019\\nFDA Logo\\nReport Problems to the Food and Drug Administration\\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

       "  'text': \"Harvey Weinstein sex crime conviction overturned and new trial ordered | CNN CNN \\xa0—\\xa0\\nThe New York Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned the sex crimes conviction against Harvey Weinstein, the powerful Hollywood producer whose downfall stood as a symbol of the #MeToo movement, and ordered a new trial.\\nThe court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled the testimony of “prior bad acts” witnesses should not have been allowed because it “was unnecessary to establish defendant’s intent and served only to establish defendant’s propensity to commit the crimes charged.”\\nWeinstein, 72, was convicted in 2020 of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and he was sentenced to 23 years in prison. He has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity.\\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said it plans to retry the case.\\n“We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,”\\xa0said Emily Tuttle, deputy director of communications and senior advisor\\xa0for the office.\\nWeinstein has been transferred from the Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome, New York, to the Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward, to\\xa0according to online records and his attorney.\\n“He is in Bellevue for medical reasons,” Weinstein’s attorney Arthur L. Aidala told CNN Saturday.\\nAidala tells CNN Weinstein is still expected to appear in Manhattan Supreme Court next Wednesday as his trial starts anew, with a new judge and prosecutor.\\nHe is unlikely to be released because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\\xa016 years in prison for charges\\xa0of rape and sexual assault. That trial similarly used “prior bad acts” witnesses and has also been appealed.\\nThursday’s ruling comes more than six years after reporting by\\xa0The New York Times and The New Yorker\\xa0in 2017 revealed Weinstein’s alleged history of sexual abuse, harassment and secret settlements as he used his influence as a Hollywood power broker to take advantage of young women.\\nAt the time, Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and helped produce movies such as “Pulp Fiction,” “Clerks” and “Shakespeare in Love.” The revelations led to a wave of women speaking publicly about the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and harassment in what became known as the #MeToo movement.\\nYet, #MeToo has had mixed success in the courtroom, and this is the second high-profile case to be overturned on appeal. The comedian Bill Cosby was convicted in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, but a Pennsylvania appeals court overturned the conviction in 2021, saying his due process rights were violated.\\nWeinstein is ‘very grateful,’ attorney says\\nThe ruling overturning Weinstein’s conviction led to a range of reactions from those involved with the case.\\nUpon hearing the news, Weinstein “heaped praise” on his legal team and was “very gracious” and “very grateful,” Aidala said.\\n“The witnesses were there just to make Harvey Weinstein look bad,” Aidala said. “That’s\\xa0the only reason why those witnesses were admitted. To show that he’s\\xa0a bad guy. He was tried on his character, not the evidence.”\\n“Justice was served,” said Donna Rotunno, the lead defense attorney at Weinstein’s trial in New York. “I believe this decision is larger than Harvey Weinstein. Courts cannot operate on emotion and lack of due process. The world is off-balance, and when the justice system does not work, nothing does. This decision restores faith in the foundation of our system.”\\n“We are cautiously excited and need to study the ramifications of the appeal decision,” Weinstein’s spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said. “We always said this was an unjust trial.”\\nFormer Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who brought the charges against Weinstein, said he was “shocked” by the decision.\\n“I am deeply grateful to and humbled by the survivors who came forward in the brightest glare of a public courtroom to tell their stories at great personal cost and trauma,” Vance said in a statement.\\xa0“The judicial system, in my opinion, has let them down today and did not advance justice. “\\nDawn Dunning, one of the “prior bad acts” witnesses in Weinstein’s trial, said in a statement she did not regret testifying and urged the district attorney’s office to retry the case.\\n“While I’m stunned that the court threw out Weinstein’s conviction on legal technicalities, I am still proud that I testified and confronted that convicted rapist,” she said. “I came forward to support other women who were also sexually abused by Weinstein and to ensure that he would be held accountable.”\\nMiriam “Mimi” Haley, whose testimony made up the first-degree criminal sexual act charge, “would consider testifying again” in a potential retrial, her attorney Gloria Allred said in a statement.\\n“Even though the process of testifying was grueling and retraumatizing for Mimi, she reaffirmed to me today that she would consider testifying again if (Manhattan) District Attorney Alvin Bragg decided to proceed with a new trial of Harvey Weinstein,” she said. “I commend Mimi on her courage and willingness to keep standing up for the truth.”\\nDouglas H. Wigdor, an attorney who has represented eight of Weinstein’s accusers, including two of the “prior bad acts” witnesses at his New York criminal trial, also criticized the decision.\\n“Today’s decision is a major step back in holding those accountable for acts of sexual violence,” he said in a statement. “Courts routinely admit evidence of other uncharged acts where they assist juries in understanding issues concerning the intent, modus operandi or scheme of the defendant.\\xa0The jury was instructed on the relevance of this testimony and overturning the verdict is tragic in that it will require the victims to endure yet another trial.”\\nWhat happened at his NY trial\\nJessica Mann was one of several women who testified at Weinstein's sexual assault trial in New York in early 2020.\\nThe New York charges were directly based on the testimony of Haley and Jessica Mann. Haley testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment, and Mann testified that he raped her in 2013 during what she described as an abusive relationship.\\nIn addition, three other women testified during the trial as “prior bad acts” witnesses as prosecutors sought to show Weinstein had a pattern of abuse. These women – Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young – each said Weinstein used his Hollywood influence to take advantage of them when they were young and hoping to break into the film industry.\\nAfter Weinstein was convicted in his New York trial, his attorneys appealed the verdict. They argued the judge should not have allowed these “prior bad acts” witnesses to testify and should not have given prosecutors the ability to question Weinstein about instances of verbal abuse and bullying on cross-examination. (Weinstein ultimately did not testify in the case.)\\nThe Court of Appeals agreed with the defense on those points.\\n“We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose,” the ruling, written by Judge Jenny Rivera, states.\\n“The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light. The synergistic effect of these errors was not harmless.”\\nYet in a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the majority opinion “perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence and allows predators to escape accountability.”\\n“This conclusion deprives juries of the context necessary to do their work, forecloses the prosecution from using an essential tool to prove intent, ignores the nuances of how sexual violence is perpetrated and perceived, and demonstrates the majority’s utter lack of understanding of the dynamics of sexual assault,” Singas wrote. “Because New York’s women deserve better, I dissent.”\\nThe use of “prior bad acts” witnesses has increased in recent years with the rise of the #MeToo movement. In sexual assault cases, their testimony can turn a difficult “he said, she said” case into a more convincing “he said, they said” case.\\nIn general, evidence that the\\xa0defendant has poor character\\xa0or has done bad things in the past is not allowed during a trial. The fear is that the jury will be overly influenced by these prior incidents and may ignore the actual evidence of the alleged crime.\\n“Prior bad acts” evidence is one exception to this rule. It can be used to prove the defendant’s “motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,” according to\\xa0federal evidence rules.\\nJudges have a fair amount of discretion to decide what is and what isn’t allowed in court as they try to balance the relevance of the testimony against the prejudice to the jury.\\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\\nCNN’s Gloria Pazmino, Matt Egan, Jean Casarez and Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.\"},\n",

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in a community in southern India and to evaluate the relationship between dyspeptic symptoms, Helicobacter pylori infection, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease. A sample population was selected randomly from a rural monastic settlement in southern India. Subjects were interviewed using a standardised symptom and demography questionnaire then underwent upper endoscopy and antral biopsy for histology and CLO rapid urease test. Altogether 197 subjects from a population of 1499 (13.1%) were studied. All were male monks and ethnically Tibetan. The median age was 28 years (range: 21-81). None smoked or took NSAIDs. The six month period prevalence of dyspeptic symptoms was 68.5%. Current symptoms were present in 58.9% of subjects. Dyspepsia was more common in subjects aged 40 years or younger (p < 0.0001). H pylori was detected in 77.2% subjects. There was no association between dyspepsia and the presence of H pylori or histological gastritis, although there was a strong correlation between symptoms and ulcer (p < 0.003). The point prevalence of active peptic ulcer was 6.6% (13/197). All ulcers detected were either prepyloric or pyloroduodenal in location. A further 6.6% of subjects had definite evidence of scarring or deformity indicative of ulceration in the past. Subjects with past or present ulcers comprised 17.8% of dyspeptic subjects. H pylori was present in all subjects with active ulcers and in 12/13 of those with scarring. Dyspepsia, H pylori infection, gastritis, and peptic ulcer are all more common in this population than in those from developed countries. Ulcer disease, however, accounts for only a small proportion of subjects with symptoms and neither H pylori infection nor gastritis are significantly associated with the presence of dyspepsia.\\nStatistics from Altmetric.com\\nRequest Permissions\\nIf you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center’s RightsLink service.

       "  'text': 'Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease: What You Should Know | Bumrungrad\\n bih.button.backtotop.text\\nGastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease: What You Should Know\\nMost people experience an occasional episode of stomach upset or indigestion that brings a few hours of discomfort and resolves on its own or with over-the-counter antacid medication.\\n\\xa0\\nSome of the more serious disorders of the stomach and stomach lining, such as gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, are more likely to develop gradually over time and progressively worsen unless diagnosed and properly treated. Their progression may also lead to dangerous situations, from internal bleeding, perforations and blockages to difficult-to-treat diseases such as gastric cancer.\\n\\xa0\\nProtecting the Stomach Lining\\nCells in the lining of the stomach produce mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach lining against possible harm from acid, bacteria and digestive enzymes, which help break down food during the digestion process. While the mucus forms a layer of protection for the stomach lining, the bicarbonate helps to neutralize stomach acid. When these protective mechanisms are weakened or compromised, the stomach lining becomes more prone to gastritis and, potentially, peptic ulcer disease.\\n\\xa0\\nUnderstanding Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease\\nGastritis refers to inflammation of the stomach lining spanning acute gastritis, chronic gastritis and atrophic gastritis. Acute gastritis occurs suddenly and, in some cases, may progress to chronic gastritis. As chronic gastritis continues to progress over a long time period, it causes a slow, gradual wearing away of the stomach lining. Chronic gastritis may also result in dysplasia or metaplasia, which involve pre-cancerous cell changes that may eventually lead to cancer if left untreated.\\n\\xa0\\nGastritis can cause erosions, or shallow sores, in the stomach lining, and the condition can lead to deeper, larger open sores called ulcers forming in the upper digestive tract, the primary indication for peptic ulcer disease. Ulcers located in the stomach lining are termed gastric ulcers, while ulcers that form at the beginning of the small intestine are duodenal ulcers. Some people develop both gastric and duodenal ulcers, while others have one but not the other.\\nSimilarity in Key Causes\\nThe two conditions share a number of similar causes. The two leading causes of both gastritis and peptic ulcer disease are infection with the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterium and the use of aspirin, ibuprofen and other pain relievers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs.\\n\\xa0\\nNSAIDs contribute to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease by inhibiting the production of an enzyme that would normally provide anti-inflammatory benefits to the stomach and help protect the stomach lining from harmful stomach acid.\\n\\xa0\\nThe H. pylori bacteria infection causes the protective mucus in the stomach and duodenum to weaken, enabling acid to penetrate through to the lining. H. pylori bacteria and stomach acid cause irritation of the stomach lining and contribute to ulcers forming. H. pylori is also known to be a risk factor for gastric cancer. Though gastric cancer rates overall have been declining, the medical community generally favors treating H. pylori infection soon after it is detected, and antibiotic treatments are highly effective.\\n\\xa0\\nGenetics is believed to be a risk factor for peptic ulcer disease. Studies have shown that people with a family history of peptic ulcers were more likely to be diagnosed with the condition.\\n\\xa0\\nMain Symptoms and Similarities\\nGastritis and peptic ulcer disease produce similar symptoms, though some patients with gastritis have no symptoms. Symptoms for both conditions may include:\\n\\xa0\\nDull or burning pain in the upper belly\\nFeeling bloated\\nFeeling full or satiated after only a small amount of food\\nHeartburn, upset stomach\\nFrequent burping\\nReduced appetite\\nNausea, together with or without vomiting\\n\\xa0\\nAlarm Symptoms\\nNot all stomach problems caused by acid turn out to be serious, and may respond well enough to over-the-counter antacids and pain relievers. But when stomach pain continues for at least two weeks, it should be treated as an alarm symptom — an important warning sign of a potentially serious underlying condition requiring urgent medical attention.\\n\\xa0\\nIn addition to continuing pain, other alarm symptoms include:\\nAnemia, which can result from blood loss due to a variety of factors, including ulcers, certain types of cancer, and the use of aspirin and other pain relievers\\nHaving black stools or reddish-colored stools, indicating the presence of blood.\\nNausea and vomiting, especially vomiting blood or having vomit that resembles dark coffee grounds\\nUnexplained weight loss comprising about 10% of total body weight occurring over a period of several weeks to several months\\nPersistent pain, especially “awakening pain”, which occurs during the night and is severe enough to cause you to suddenly wake up from sleep.\\n\\xa0\\nDiagnosis and Treatment\\nFor gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, the first diagnostic step is determining whether H. pylori infection is present or not, since H. pylori typically requires a different type of treatment compared to cases of gastritis or peptic ulcer disease where H. pylori is not present. H. pylori testing can be performed with blood, breath, stool or issue/biopsy tests.\\n\\xa0\\nH. pylori treatment typically takes about two weeks, sometimes longer, and involves a combination of several medicines, including antibiotics to kill the bacteria and an acid-suppressing medication known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Follow-up diagnostic testing is often recommended to confirm that the H. pylori infection has been successfully eliminated.\\n\\xa0\\nIf an ulcer is suspected in the upper GI tract, your doctor may recommend a gastroscopy, an endoscopic procedure to visually inspect the inside of your stomach and small intestine. Endoscopy is a procedure in which a thin flexible tube with a tiny camera mounted on the tip is inserted down the throat and into the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. The camera can reveal potential ulcer sites,\\xa0and\\xa0the endoscope can take tissue samples for follow-up analysis.\\n\\xa0\\nUpper GI Series Imaging\\nBoth gastritis and peptic ulcer disease may be diagnosed through a diagnostic endoscopy or an upper GI series test, also known as a barium swallow. The procedure involves a series of gastro-intestinal X-rays of the digestive system, including the stomach and small intestine. The patient swallows a chalky liquid containing barium, a substance which improves the visibility of any ulcers on X-ray images.\\n\\xa0\\nAcid-reducing Treatments\\nIn gastritis or peptic ulcer disease cases that do not involve the H. pylori bacteria, most treatments involve medications such as antacids, histamine blockers and proton pump inhibitors, which inhibit the production of acid in the stomach. Most patients with peptic ulcer disease respond well to treatments using two or more types of medication to reduce acid and protect the lining of the stomach and duodenum. Treatment times can vary from several weeks to several months.\\n\\xa0\\nThe Influence of Gut Microbiota\\nLooking beyond diseases of the stomach, a growing body of research on the micro-organisms populating the gastrointestinal tract — known as gut microbiota — is pointing to a potentially strong connection between imbalances in gut microbiota and inflammatory disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as infections and immune system disorders. With research continuing to expand the scientific community’s understanding of gut microbiota, the coming years could see a number of advances in disease prevention and treatment.\\n\\xa0\\nBy Dr. Suriya Chakkaphak, Digestive Disease Center, Bumrungrad International Hospital\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information please contact:\\nLast modify: April 29, 2025\\nRelated Packages\\nRelated Health Blogs'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Budget DIY Wireless Split Keyboard With ZMK : 11 Steps (with Pictures) - Instructables Introduction: Budget DIY Wireless Split Keyboard With ZMK\\nAbout: I build software/hardware projects and share how I make them: what works, what doesn’t, and the process along the way.\\nI built my own version of the Corne (aka \"Helidox\") split mechanical keyboard fully hand-wired, low-profile, and wireless. No custom PCBs here — just prototyping, patience, and a lot of soldering. The goal was to make a compact, ergonomic keyboard that’s portable and customizable without relying on pre-made PCBs or expensive parts.\\nOne of my main goals was to keep the build budget-friendly, so anyone could make it. Most DIY split keyboards online cost well over $100. I wanted to prove that you don’t need to spend that much to get a clean, fully functional, and wireless keyboard.\\nThis version uses ZMK firmware and dual controllers to enable Bluetooth connectivity, letting each half communicate wirelessly. I made this project to challenge myself, understand keyboard firmware better, and create a custom tool tailored to how I type and work.\\nIf you’re into DIY electronics, mechanical keyboards, or just want a real hands-on build that won’t drain your wallet — this one’s for you.\\nGitHubRepoLink\\nSupplies\\nSupplies\\n2× ProMicro nRF52840 boards – $6.82 total\\nBuy on AliExpress\\n2× Li-ion batteries – $4.20 total\\nBuy on AliExpress\\n50× Mechanical switches – $7.47 total\\nBuy on AliExpress\\n1× Set of keycaps – $3.79\\nOption 1 / Option 2\\n~60× 1N4148 diodes – $0.85 total\\nBuy on AliExpress\\n2× Slide switches – $0.11 total\\n(Generic – no link)\\n3D Printed case parts – $1.80\\n(Files provided in the repo)\\nTotal estimated cost: $25.04 (excluding wires and screws)\\nStep 1: Print or Design Your Case\\nBegin by 3D printing the provided STL files for the keyboard case, or design your own if you prefer. Pay close attention to the battery compartment. If your batteries are even slightly swollen or puffed, they will cause warping or misalignment issues with the case. Using fresh, flat batteries is critical to ensure a clean fit. A warped case will cause problems when assembling the keyboard later, so take your time to get this right.\\nStep 2: Wire the Columns\\nStart wiring the keyboard matrix by soldering the column lines. These are the vertical rows of your key matrix, and each wire will carry signals from multiple keys along a column. Use solid core wire or stranded wire carefully stripped and tinned to ensure clean solder joints. Make sure the wires are routed neatly and avoid excess slack. Good cable management now will save headaches later.\\nStep 3: Wire the Rows Via the Diode Cathodes\\nNext, wire the row lines, but this time through the diodes to prevent “ghosting” or phantom key presses. Each key switch connects to a diode. The diode’s cathode (marked with a line) should be connected to the row wire, while the anode side connects to the switch itself. This setup ensures current flows in only one direction through the matrix, isolating each key press electrically. Double-check your diode orientation; reversing them will break the matrix.\\nStep 4: Connect Extra Conductors to Rows and Columns\\nTo organize wiring and simplify connections to the microcontroller, attach additional conductor wires to each row and column line. These extra wires should be tucked neatly underneath or alongside your existing wiring bundles. This step consolidates your wiring and prevents signal interference or shorts when connecting to the MCU. Take your time to route cables cleanly.\\nStep 5: Connect All Rows and Columns to the MCU Pins\\nNow it’s time to wire the rows and columns directly to your microcontroller unit (MCU). Here are the exact pin assignments to follow for each line:\\nRows (connected to row GPIO pins):\\nRow 0 → Pin 21\\nRow 1 → Pin 20\\nRow 2 → Pin 19\\nRow 3 → Pin 18\\nColumns (connected to column GPIO pins):\\nColumn 0 → Pin 2\\nColumn 1 → Pin 7\\nColumn 2 → Pin 6\\nColumn 3 → Pin 5\\nColumn 4 → Pin 4\\nColumn 5 → Pin 3\\nEnsure every wire is solidly soldered and there are no cold joints. Test continuity with a multimeter if needed before powering the board.\\nStep 6: Add the Battery and Slide Switch for Power Control\\nIntegrate the power supply by connecting the battery and the slide switch:\\nThe middle pin of the slide switch connects to the MCU’s RAW input pin, which is the voltage input for powering the board.\\nOne of the side pins of the slide switch connects to the positive terminal of the battery.\\nThe battery’s negative terminal connects to the MCU’s GND (ground) pin.\\nThis wiring lets the slide switch turn the entire keyboard on or off safely by controlling the power input line. Double-check polarity. Reversing battery connections can damage components.\\nStep 7: Secure Components With Hot Glue\\nTo prevent physical strain on your solder joints and keep components firmly in place, apply hot glue behind the slide switch and the MCU, especially around areas where cables connect. This step is crucial for durability, as loose wiring or movement can cause shorts or broken connections during use or transport. Use small amounts of glue so you can still access components if needed.\\nStep 8: Flash the Firmware\\nYou’ll need to flash three files to the controllers:\\ncorne_left-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2 – firmware for the left half\\ncorne_right-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2 – firmware for the right half\\nsettings_reset-nice_nano_v2-zmk.uf2 – resets Bluetooth pairing info\\nWhy reset?\\nZMK stores Bluetooth bonding info. The settings_reset.uf2 clears this, preventing pairing issues. Always flash this before flashing the firmware.\\nHow to flash:\\nDouble-tap the reset button on your MCU. It should show up as a USB drive.\\nFirst, drag settings_reset.uf2 onto the drive. Let the board reboot.\\nDouble-tap reset again, and now drag either left.uf2 or right.uf2 depending on the half.\\nRepeat this process on the other half.\\ngithub_firmware_link\\nStep 9: Testing\\nTurn on both halves using the slide switches.\\nThe halves will automatically search for each other and pair wirelessly. No need to press any reset buttons.\\nOne of the halves (the left) will show up as a Bluetooth keyboard when you connect it to your computer.\\nPair it via your system\\'s Bluetooth settings.\\nOnce connected, test every key. If something doesn’t register, recheck your wiring — especially diode direction and GPIO pin mapping.\\nStep 10: Screw the Case Together\\nPlace the top plate into the 3D printed case and secure it with screws. Make sure no wires are being pinched. Once closed, your keyboard halves should feel solid and ready to use.\\nStep 11: Customize Your Keymap\\nIf you\\'re not satisfied with the default keyboard layout — and let’s be honest, you probably aren’t, you’ve got options.\\nYou can clone the GitHub repo and directly edit the keymap files in the ZMK config to suit your preferences. But if you want an easier, UI-based method, just use this tool:\\n👉 https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/\\nIt lets you customize your keymap visually and then export it, so you can plug it right into the firmware.\\nWhether you want to change layer functionality, add macros, or make your own layout from scratch.'}]"
